1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,560
Audrow Nash: This is a
conversation with our friends

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,300
who is the founder and CEO of
MangDang. MangDang makes an open source

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,200
robot dog aimed Minipupper,
that's roughly the size of a

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,190
shoebox, and runs the robot
operating system. What I think

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,580
is so cool about Minipupper is
that it seems well positioned to

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,170
lower the barrier of entry for a
good robotics education. I think

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,430
this is true for two reasons.
Many poppers inexpensive, yet

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,580
quite capable, so you can do and
learn interesting robotics

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,920
things with it. And many popper
has a community around it, both

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,000
with the robot operating system
for software, and as an open

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,260
source hardware platform with a
good number of users. This

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,860
community is important so that
people can turn online for help

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,450
rather than requiring an in
house expert. I'm Audrow Nash.

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,600
This is the Sense Think Act
Podcast. Thank you to our

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,960
founding sponsor Open Robotics.
If you enjoy this episode,

please consider subscribing. And
now here's my conversation with

17
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,510
Afreez. I have friends,
would you introduce yourself?

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,260
Afreez Gan: Hi, Audrow. Sure.
I'm Afreez. I'm the founder and

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,390
Product Manager of MangDang
company.

20
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,260
Audrow Nash: Yeah. And what do
you guys make at MangDang?

21
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,950
Afreez Gan: Yeah, MangDang. When
you set up a company, you have

22
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:38,580
to give a name. Finally, I left
my hometown. MangDang is my home

23
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:38,700
town.

24
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,830
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. That's a
nice name. And you make the

25
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,650
Minipupper? Would you tell me a
bit about the Minipupper?

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:55,830
Afreez Gan: Yeah, Minipupper is
is a ROS, OpenCV, robot dog

27
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,810
platform meant for education.
actually come from Stanford, the

28
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,740
Pupper project. Another very
awesome. Open Source project.

29
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:11,550
Yeah.

30
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,350
Audrow Nash: And what does the
Minipupper look like? I think

31
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,570
you have one there, but just for
our listeners.

32
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:25,590
Afreez Gan: Yeah. This is the
Minipupper. It have LCD display.

33
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:32,760
Audrow Nash: Yep. So it's, uh,
oh, go ahead. Yeah, I can

34
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,290
describe it if you like, from
how I think it looks. It's it's

35
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,270
kind of like a little Spot from
Boston Dynamics. Like a little

36
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:48,690
quadruped, robot dog. It has. Oh,
yeah, go ahead.

37
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:54,989
Afreez Gan: Yeah, you know, you
maybe I think most of the guys

38
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:01,619
are already see the demo from
Boston Dynamics spotted me. And

39
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:05,279
as you know, most of the guys
that want to own their own robot

40
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:10,349
that was to explore. Definitely.
But you know, you notice that

41
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:17,699
the pricing is so high and it is
hard to to accept it. So. So we

42
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:26,579
wanted to make a similar meaning
robot everywhere. All right.

43
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:27,779
Exactly.

44
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:31,229
Audrow Nash: Yes. And then one
thing that's very different

45
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:35,099
between the Boston Dynamics one,
and Minipupper is Minipupper

46
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,019
is very small. It's like, how
long is the body? Maybe it's 30

47
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:48,269
centimeters or a foot long. And
it stands out maybe? Ah, okay,

48
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:52,049
so eight inches long and it
probably stands What 10

49
00:03:52,049 --> 00:04:00,599
centimeters high, or 15
centimeters high. Okay. 1515 six

50
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,279
inches high. So it's really cute
and then has the LCD or the

51
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:09,149
display on its front. So you can
have eyes and this kind of

52
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,369
thing. Oh, yeah.

53
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:18,389
Afreez Gan: We can also add
later and camera sensor to

54
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,529
those.

55
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,830
Audrow Nash: Yes. And then so
how did Minipupper come out of

56
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:31,080
the Standford Pupper? How What's
the origin of Minipupper?

57
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:40,710
Afreez Gan: Okay, is a story
beginning 20th 20th At first I

58
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:46,830
was only a fan Oh was Stanford a
pupper project and sometimes I

59
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,130
will answer some a normal
question. He is a group for

60
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:58,920
other guys. Other new guys. And
then we made made a good friend

61
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,440
of his amazing car. As the
project owner, and they has

62
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,720
Stanford a paper vendor, we ship
to many staff for the keys

63
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,090
worldwide, and have just started
global to head with sample

64
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,490
paper, we've got a ton of
feedback from as the customers,

65
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,470
what do our customers want in
their products? And What Kind Of

66
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,420
Products Do They like? We learn
that a lot of our crew lessons

67
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:38,280
and how to make a robot after
more than one years, we will

68
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,530
release the manufacturer
product. Yeah, actually, and

69
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,030
help that brought us to the side
by staff for the PEPFAR and the

70
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,240
Enlightened collaboration with
anything out so really no

71
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,130
creator of a snapper Pupper.

72
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,880
Audrow Nash: How is it
different? How so Minipupper is

73
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,390
a little smaller than the
Standford Pupper? Right, Mike? Is

74
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,560
there any other differences? So
the maybe the Standford Pupper is

75
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,010
I don't know it stands a foot
high or something like this or

76
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,210
30 centimeter side

77
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,700
Afreez Gan: is it bigger than
that? Yeah, about all this

78
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,380
searching certified I remember
35 or

79
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:26,820
Audrow Nash: 35 Okay, 14 inches
I something like this, okay. So,

80
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,210
how else is the Minipupper
different than the Stanford

81
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:35,580
popper you made it so that it
could be better manufactured or?

82
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:36,690
Yeah.

83
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,360
Afreez Gan: Actually, as I said
before, we delivered many

84
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,830
several hangers Stanford a
Pupper device and it got a

85
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:54,060
market cap and we know actually,
we find Sen staff at a Pupper

86
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,530
project he is awesome project
manager they are also some

87
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:06,000
problem. So we want to fix them
for what kind of problems Yeah.

88
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:16,980
For example, about assemble or
somebody we actually optimize

89
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,600
something or some point for
example, way more we're waiting

90
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:30,240
here. So please yeah, to make it
a more easier to assemble and

91
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:36,450
remove eliminate something
wrong. This is the assemble and

92
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:43,050
about as a calibration staffer
Pupper are really no project we

93
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:49,560
should use a command line tool
calibration. Yeah, in Nicaragua,

94
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:56,610
we emplacement CUI tool and the
user can use it very convenient.

95
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:06,060
And just not the same point is
we make a smaller much smaller

96
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:12,180
to make it a more safe security,
you know, when you're debugging

97
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,540
a robot, sometimes enemy the out
of control exists of performance

98
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:25,080
is so powerful, it may be a
security risk. So, we make a

99
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:30,210
huge especially for the children
Yeah, for sure we make it much

100
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:37,980
smaller. And it is said even for
children and adolescents

101
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,780
software to your point that is a
sample pack for our project is

102
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:56,370
based around leanings we it is
good for for programmer at the

103
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:04,230
end of February we Haussler the
software you know we supply is

104
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,020
open source for
the last SLAM navigation and

105
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:17,010
the Open City functions people
can use data to do a much more

106
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:27,030
use case and they the document
way especially opposed actually

107
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,180
when when they think How are
released Standford Pupper project

108
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:40,350
I began I began to follow this
piece of project and by all

109
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:46,350
those components the firm's USA
and studied as a project at

110
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:51,120
first. The source code is now
stables document that is not

111
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:59,520
very well but now it is okay.
But actually I remember I used

112
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:06,240
it on last two months tools to
rise, staffer the Minipupper project.

113
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:13,080
So I think if we're, if we want
to release a project, we hope

114
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,690
our user can use it very easily
and very quickly. For example,

115
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,700
when they do they have several
hours, they can assemble it and

116
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:30,270
enjoy it. So that way we supply
more document or user guide.

117
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:31,320
Yeah.

118
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,800
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. That's
nice. I mean, if it has poor

119
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,670
documentation, and the source
code is tough to go through, it

120
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,760
can be such a bottle neck to
like actually getting anything

121
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,120
done with it or trying things on
it. And then the fun robotics

122
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,500
project can be very difficult.
So this sounds really nice if

123
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,740
you improve the documentation
and give it ROS interfaces and

124
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,090
things like this.

125
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:05,400
Afreez Gan: And saying they were
also held as pre immediate, pre

126
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:13,710
pre compile that I need. People
are fo user, customer don't want

127
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,550
to compile the source code for
several hours so they can

128
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,210
download the image. And the
flesh is that as the cat, okay.

129
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,250
Audrow Nash: So you can set it
up more easily. To have it all.

130
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:33,450
Wonderful. Yes. Let's see. So
I'd like to get into I would

131
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,820
love to talk about the software.
But I'd like to get a little bit

132
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,230
into the hardware of the mini
popper. And like what it has on

133
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:46,680
board. So how you first off, it
has a Raspberry Pi for the

134
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,690
computer, right? Yeah. Yeah, the
main controller is the Raspberry

135
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:57,120
Pi. Okay. Yes. And then

136
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,160
Afreez Gan: that's also based on
rest path.

137
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,100
Audrow Nash: Yes. Awesome. And
then then you probably what do

138
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,010
you have like a motor driver
board or something that the

139
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,760
Raspberry Pi controls? Or how
does it How does it work? And

140
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,230
then it's connected to servos?

141
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:24,120
Afreez Gan: Yeah, we actually we
cut some much. Cut them about

142
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,620
connected to earthbath.

143
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,810
Audrow Nash: Oh, good Arduino.
Is that Arduino? I can't quite

144
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,500
tell with the

145
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:37,080
Afreez Gan: Yeah, we connect all
the servers to our cutter MOBA.

146
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,380
Audrow Nash: Ah, or your custom
board? Oh, okay.

147
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,270
Afreez Gan: Yeah, this could be
the because this is

148
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,010
Audrow Nash: Yep, there's a
Raspberry Pi. Custom board. I

149
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,270
mean, yeah, just pop right in.
And that custom board has a

150
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,700
circle missing from it. And I
guess that's for some peripheral

151
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,160
or something that the Raspberry
Pi that has that sticks through

152
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:17,550
it. That's very cool. Yeah. So
then, you how many servos? Does

153
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:26,850
the minibuffer have? 12. Gotcha.
And so for each leg. What's so I

154
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,950
assume that it's three per leg?

155
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,320
Afreez Gan: Three steps.

156
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,350
Audrow Nash: You're so prepared
with all the different pieces

157
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,550
for explaining it. Love it.

158
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,040
Afreez Gan: Yeah. Okay.

159
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,260
Audrow Nash: So you have one. So
you have the, basically that

160
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,610
elbow of the leg, the shoulder
of the leg, which moves one

161
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,020
direction and the shoulder also
moves. Let's see. So you have

162
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,380
two degrees of freedom in the
shoulder. Yeah, you could have

163
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:01,380
done it. Very cool. And these so
they're servo motors. And you

164
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,890
custom built them right for this
for the mini bumper.

165
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,880
Afreez Gan: Yeah, yes. Actually,
we don't have to cut them a

166
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:19,710
hater, but we have to, because
at first the we buy all kinds of

167
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:26,160
ministers from the market, but
we don't, we don't find that

168
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:35,610
anyone can meet our requirement.
You know, if we, we, we we want

169
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:42,930
to design a mini size Dhokla dog
and we'd have to use mini mini

170
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:53,730
serve as small as possible. But
we pies on the shelf. Sir. We

171
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,800
cannot find anyone can meet our
requirements. You know, we can

172
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:05,580
sometimes times we assemble it
and arrive our robot several

173
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:13,380
minutes or several hours. So
we'll book break. Yeah. So we,

174
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:21,030
we, I last week where we spend,
I remember above the three

175
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:29,520
months to work with our factory
with our sub factory to cotton

176
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,140
was a syrup. Yeah.

177
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,240
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. And you
made them? What was the major

178
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,870
challenge in making your own
one? Like, what? Why? Why

179
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,290
couldn't you use the existing
ones? They weren't small enough?

180
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,320
They weren't reliable enough.
You said they break frequently?

181
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,120
Is it just reliability?

182
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:58,050
Afreez Gan: Yeah, yes, it will.
If you want to make cameras if

183
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:02,340
you have enough party to add
them. Because if you want to

184
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:08,340
make a custom component, the
factory will ask your forecast

185
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,470
and your budget. Yeah, if you're
in a party, that there is no

186
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,930
problem. But actually, we have
not much value that at first. So

187
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:27,570
we have to reuse as many as
their components and also meet

188
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,440
our requirement.

189
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,420
Audrow Nash: So you're saying
the factory wanted to reuse its

190
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,410
existing tooling to make the
servos? Or do I understand,

191
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,270
right? So you can keep the price
down? Because it's already what

192
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,410
the factory has.

193
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:49,800
Afreez Gan: Yeah, but we, we
could work with cell factory and

194
00:16:51,150 --> 00:17:01,590
replaced the motor inside, we
use the best motor and we can

195
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:09,210
can we adjust some parameters?
Control power inside is us. So

196
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:09,750
Mita

197
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:14,580
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah.
And the motors, their servo

198
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,240
motors, so there's no series
elastic components? You know

199
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,210
what I mean, with that there's
no spring in series with the

200
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,010
motor or anything? Or is there?

201
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:27,420
Afreez Gan: No. Agenda thought?
Or the inside is a third was a

202
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,380
very small motor. Yeah, yep.

203
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,900
Audrow Nash: Is there? Is there
a spring in the motor? Or do you

204
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,530
because you know how with some
of the legged robots, they'll do

205
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,910
series, elastic actuation they
have a spring in parallel or in

206
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:50,940
series with the motor. So it can
deform and deal with the heart

207
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,170
impact of the motor hitting the
ground or of the feet hitting

208
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:55,620
the ground

209
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,330
Afreez Gan: that way? Yeah. Are
you doing wait? Yeah, when we

210
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:05,460
run the robot, there will be
there will be very hot inside.

211
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:14,910
So, so we have to, we have to
find a solution. How to Win way.

212
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,820
So how to how to make it work
stable. And what

213
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,230
Audrow Nash: do you do? Are you
just downright solution to that?

214
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:33,570
Afreez Gan: Yeah. Actually, as a
sort of factory and as to learn

215
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:40,830
how to test and also just some
parameters about the control

216
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,290
board inside sir.

217
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,670
Audrow Nash: Okay, what kind of
parameters? What did they

218
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:55,140
adjust? So is it is it basically
how far the servo will try to

219
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,520
maintain an accurate position or
what, like how much effort it

220
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,420
will put into that I'm not
terribly knowledgeable about

221
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,980
servos and controlling them.

222
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:13,980
Afreez Gan: Yeah. Actually, I
don't remember very clear, I

223
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,870
think because they are about to
two centimeters, and one is way

224
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,630
just as parameters and another
solution is the way they think

225
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:30,180
it they replace that much better
motor inside and other

226
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,990
mechanical optimization.

227
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,490
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Now, to
make it so you can handle the

228
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:46,560
heat and make it suitable for a
legged robot. Gotcha. So is, is

229
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,460
Minipupper is it basically, you
have the control board in the

230
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,030
middle and then you have a way
of communicating to the servos

231
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,860
and driving power through it.
But otherwise the legs the legs

232
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,910
are just the server was
connected. Basically in order,

233
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,080
there's no springs, there's no
soft components, there's this

234
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,300
kind of thing. And it works
because it's a small little

235
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,860
robot. Right? Or is that? Is
that a fair way to describe it?

236
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,170
Afreez Gan: Yes. You mean,
whether it is there any feedback

237
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,620
about a position feedback about
the chart feedback? I'm

238
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,230
Audrow Nash: sure there's
position feedback. I mean,

239
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:36,360
Afreez Gan: what is this for?
Now? What? Now? Is silver fair?

240
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,170
There are no any feedback. Wow,
it's all

241
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:40,770
Audrow Nash: open loop.

242
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:52,080
Afreez Gan: Yeah. But you will
know if we use we always

243
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:58,620
balances the price and as a
performance Yes. How also used

244
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:07,260
today by just with many with
many feedback, but a surprising

245
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,360
Yes. So hi. Oh,

246
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,930
Audrow Nash: so your servos
don't even have feedback really?

247
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,550
Yes. Now, what I thought I
thought servos were all closed

248
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,850
loop. But I guess if you

249
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,510
Afreez Gan: if you if so, now, I
mean, you have our country

250
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:35,850
control algorithm is the open
loop control, it is simple. But

251
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:45,840
it is also if you want to do
some deep play algorism it is it

252
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:54,150
is hard to because there is the
open loop is on extraversion we

253
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,750
are designing our next quarter
where we will analyze the

254
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:04,590
feedback but as I said before we
we have to balance the price and

255
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,550
performance

256
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,000
Audrow Nash: what is the mini
popper now Yeah,

257
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:21,360
Afreez Gan: about $500 for the
kid gotcha yeah don't put any

258
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,220
also is in our next reversion we
will add his position and

259
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:34,530
feedback with not much high
price almost the same price. We

260
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:39,540
find a simple way to get the
position and feedback.

261
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,530
Audrow Nash: Very cool. Okay,
when do you think that next

262
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:48,660
version will come out? As you
just had this current version, I

263
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,050
think

264
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,860
Afreez Gan: hey, this is kind of
our our next version and we hope

265
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,580
to we can release eight into
outline

266
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,850
Audrow Nash: wow so fast. Okay,
yeah, that's awesome. How do you

267
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,100
how do you get the robot to walk
do you use is there like an open

268
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:15,600
source robot legged locomotion
lab or is our open source open

269
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,290
source library that you can use
or did you write it from scratch

270
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:23,790
or how do you do your control
your legged locomotion control?

271
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:36,660
Afreez Gan: Yeah, this is
another story at first you were

272
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:42,720
at a frosted away our software
base roster for the Pupper

273
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:52,560
software we have we have to work
software, why is the base work

274
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:58,950
it is a similar stamp at the
Pupper paper okay and the other

275
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:06,210
version is loss worship. Again
the nose warfare we have to

276
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:15,330
implement the framework to
control the lag very common

277
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,860
framework for the wheel robot,
you know there there is a turtle

278
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:29,220
bot platform many guys Yeah, it
is a very common framework for

279
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,320
the wheel the project that
badger April, we if we want to

280
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:41,490
implement as a lag robot based
on Joe's platform, we have to

281
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:49,740
design and implement has the
framework at first we I asked

282
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,310
several technical guys and it is
has almost I remember almost two

283
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:02,820
months, how to design it or how
to end Dementor How long do can

284
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:09,720
we implement as a laughter? We
are very lucky, we found there

285
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:17,220
are already a good project, you
could have another open source

286
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:25,590
project. Then Kemper lead by
Biogen, who is located in

287
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,330
Singapore. We are now we are
very good friends now. And

288
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:37,650
during our project we he also
give us a much have. Yeah.

289
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,420
Audrow Nash: Wonderful. So, you
found an open source solution

290
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,470
you were able to use with ROS
and that gets you most of the

291
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,910
way did you have to extend it or
did you put code back into the

292
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,330
original to improve it? Or do
you just use it as is

293
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:00,930
Afreez Gan: actually way way it
is not only just the integrated

294
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:07,350
way which we are based his
project that by the way are also

295
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:12,480
double confirm with you and
discuss with you and how to use

296
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,660
data. Much better. And you
Pupper? Yeah.

297
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,620
Audrow Nash: Yeah, you optimize
it from there. So it works

298
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:27,300
really well. Yeah. Awesome.
Okay, how did you? How did you

299
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,140
optimize it for Minipupper?
Like I've seen some things where

300
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:35,730
they would have they for you
know, the robot soccer

301
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,240
tournaments and they'd have a
little now robot go and try to

302
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,040
kick the ball. I would they were
trying to make them the now

303
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,580
robots really fast. I think it
was now actually, maybe I may be

304
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,800
wrong. I think it's not an hour
robot. I think it's some other

305
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,520
humanoid robot. But what they
did is they would set them up

306
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,520
and have them race back and
forth with different parameter

307
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:03,390
sets. To try to find the fastest
parameters. How did you? How did

308
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:07,320
you get it prepared for mini
popper? Did you do something

309
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,010
similar? Where you're racing
back and forth? Or how did you

310
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,270
find what works really? Well?

311
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,060
Afreez Gan: Yeah, our target
mini perpetuity is for the

312
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:25,140
education, but not for the race
competition. So we have to make

313
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:33,060
it as simple as possible to make
other guys to study or catamaran

314
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:40,440
if we have a freezer robot,
because it is a very small robot

315
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:47,070
dog and component, the surf is
is a low cost result is the

316
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:52,350
performance is okay for me
Pupper patter. Eight is a view

317
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:57,150
want to write very quickly.
Maybe it will not as stable.

318
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:04,470
Maybe. Yeah. All over. Yeah.
Yeah. But if it didn't write up,

319
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,720
I don't have enough. You cannot
use the leader ADCs encoder for

320
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:16,110
later to do your system and
navigation because it is another

321
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,940
stable and Amanda,

322
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,220
Audrow Nash: it's shifting
shifting. Yeah. keeps breaking

323
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,640
its map

324
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,550
Afreez Gan: to build as a map.
Yeah. Yes, because

325
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,830
Audrow Nash: you use the planar
LIDAR. Right? On many bumper. So

326
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:35,070
it's the LIDAR that shoots
straight out. And so if you have

327
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,650
the plane going out, and it's
tipping, tipping tipping, and

328
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,810
you're trying to use that as
your map, that would be really

329
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:43,290
difficult, I imagine to build a
world map.

330
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,340
Afreez Gan: Yeah, well, you
could imagine and make a that

331
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,480
around more stable, stable,
they're able to do

332
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,980
Audrow Nash: so stability was
kind of the big thing you

333
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,810
optimized for when trying to
make Minipupper walk, not like

334
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:04,650
speed or anything because you're
interested in it for education.

335
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,620
And that means like, can you
learn with this as a platform?

336
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,820
Yeah. Yeah. And so then you can
try learning about Lidar and

337
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:18,120
whatever other sensors, your
cameras. Okay, yeah. Tell me a

338
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,620
bit more. So, is this robot
already being used in education

339
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,730
and where and how is it being
used in the curriculum?

340
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:37,230
Afreez Gan: Humans education,
right. Yes. Yeah, yeah. deoria

341
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:45,930
we deliver as Stanford a Pupper
our units, we, we found many.

342
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:54,570
Some of the user come from the
university, most of the

343
00:29:54,570 --> 00:30:01,980
university. Yeah. Even some PhD
students. Yeah. And they, yeah,

344
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:10,290
they hope they they can they
looking forward acceptable a

345
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:17,400
robot have a platform to test
their algorithm, maybe as video

346
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:25,500
algorithm or other AI algorithm.
So wait, you have the with. And

347
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:34,200
now, as I know, some, some
universities are trying to, to

348
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:40,140
use me Pupper for their lessons.
And we are also discussing with

349
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:48,300
how to improve MiniPro. And what
they are looking for. Yeah, I

350
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:54,990
think it is a long, long journey
to improve the education

351
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,330
platform. Yeah.

352
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,970
Audrow Nash: So it's mostly
targeting universities, not like

353
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:07,020
high schools or middle schools
or anything like this.

354
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:15,750
Afreez Gan: Yeah. Actually, at
current our, our level now, the

355
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:20,010
most students come from the
university, but they are also

356
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:25,830
some come from the middle
school, high school. Okay, if

357
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,280
we,

358
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:29,069
Audrow Nash: yes, just starting?
Yeah.

359
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,680
Afreez Gan: Because it's not
easy.

360
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,420
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Yes, for
sure. Especially I imagine going

361
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,170
from university like starting
with grad students, and then

362
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,230
going towards maybe undergrads
and you teach them during your

363
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:51,330
education. And then like, the
further the lower and age you

364
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,690
go, are there like the lower and
education level? I imagine the

365
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,170
harder it is because you need to
develop a more structured

366
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,300
curriculum, I would imagine.
Yeah. Like, with the PhD

367
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,330
students, you say, here's some
documentation on how it works.

368
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:11,250
And they go off and do things.
And then with the with the

369
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,740
undergrads are doing their
coursework? I imagine you still

370
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,860
have to put together a little
bit of a curriculum or work with

371
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,880
professors or technicians at the
university to put together a

372
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,670
curriculum. Have you done much
of that, where you're putting

373
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:29,400
together a curriculum around
Minipupper and the kinds of

374
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,210
things that can do?

375
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:39,120
Afreez Gan: Yeah. Now, we are,
we are just supplying the proper

376
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:45,420
answers there. based platform.
You know, your university

377
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:52,530
students have the technical
background. And we only can

378
00:32:52,530 --> 00:33:01,440
supply the the general user
guide and the time period. And

379
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,430
if they have some problem, we
can they can say No, for me, I

380
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:06,149
Audrow Nash: come to you.

381
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:10,350
Afreez Gan: Yeah. So we kind of
suppose that. Yeah.

382
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,930
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Any plans
in the future to possibly help

383
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:20,250
with the curriculum design
around the Minipupper? Or is it

384
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:25,440
kind of your documentation is in
a sense, the well it is the

385
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,850
documentation you're planning on
using or not? Not necessarily

386
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,410
attaching a course to it?

387
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:37,590
Afreez Gan: Yeah, actually, we
were planning how to make a

388
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:48,360
detailed document or user guide,
where we hope to make a a real

389
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:52,680
education platform, not only for
the university is to say that we

390
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:58,650
can also hope we'll also have
the middle school high school

391
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:07,710
students to learn understanding.
We can make a detailed document

392
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,990
for all level users.

393
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,200
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Have you
started that? Or is it it's a

394
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,400
future efforts?

395
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:23,159
Afreez Gan: Yeah, we are. Where
are you in? Yeah, we have online

396
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:32,639
online document that we will add
as a additional part, standby

397
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:43,709
snap. Yeah, we hope we can.
Finish is a document we see as

398
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:45,299
three or five months.

399
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:49,409
Audrow Nash: Ah, very exciting.
And then maybe you'll see more

400
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:53,519
universities using it and it
will grow from there. That'd be

401
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:58,499
very cool to have a very nice,
inexpensive legged robot like

402
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:03,209
how cool I mean In my robotics
education I was using lucky to

403
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:06,959
have the thing, but like little
tiny robots that had a lidar on

404
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:10,469
top and didn't navigation, and
legged robots are just so much.

405
00:35:10,649 --> 00:35:14,219
There I am. I'm so much more
interested in legged robots than

406
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:17,639
wheeled robots. And so it's
really cool if that can be in

407
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:24,089
the education program. Yeah. How
do you how do you work to make

408
00:35:24,149 --> 00:35:28,229
really good documentation?
Because I think a lot of like,

409
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,079
many of the robots I've used
that have come from factories,

410
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:35,189
have had pretty terrible
documentation. How do you try to

411
00:35:35,189 --> 00:35:40,889
make good documentation any, any
ideas on what you can do to make

412
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,209
it as good as possible? Or?

413
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:50,850
Afreez Gan: Yeah. And of course,
we have many improvements of the

414
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,590
document. And of course, the we
made our first version document,

415
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:01,590
and user will give you many,
many feedback. And the user can

416
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:12,210
maybe make their own User Guide.
For example, when it is the many

417
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,790
hundreds of a device to Japan
marking and sun. Japan makers

418
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:22,200
that make their own token are
very detailed a document, so I

419
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,440
Audrow Nash: will put it back
in.

420
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:31,530
Afreez Gan: Yeah. So we actually
a lot of money is not only come

421
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:39,150
from us, but also come from all
the guys, all the customers, we

422
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:43,950
are cool, and contributing to
the Terminator data, and making

423
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,410
it more and more better.

424
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:51,540
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Very cool.
And so you mentioned a little

425
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:56,790
bit, you can put a lidar on top
of the menu upper. I think you

426
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:01,770
can also put a what is it? Is it
an oak D? 3d camera?

427
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:08,340
Afreez Gan: Yeah, open CV? 3d
camera module? Yeah, yeah. So

428
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:16,890
yeah, ideas. Lead by branding,
branding team. Branding is open

429
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:24,060
CVA, a key architect, architect.
And, yeah, he's also the CEO of

430
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,600
Orlok. Sonics company, located
the AAMC. Okay.

431
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,840
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So, you put
these sensors on, and these are

432
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,300
so that people who are
interested in playing around

433
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,790
with it. So whether it be
students or I can even see

434
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,910
hobbyists being very interested
in playing with mining like I,

435
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:45,900
for example, I'm interested in
playing with one of the many

436
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,040
buffers, but so you can put the
sensors on it. And with the

437
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,190
camera and the LiDAR, you can
build a map. And you can do a

438
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,700
lot of different robotics
things. Because you can have the

439
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,330
robot map its space and move
around in the space and do some

440
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:03,930
understanding of the scene or
the environment. That's kind of

441
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,660
the intention with those to
enable it so people can use

442
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,560
them, or, yeah, it's quite cool.

443
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:17,999
Afreez Gan: Yeah, you're right,
we've put later this place and

444
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:23,519
we can put his camera at this
place. Yeah, we

445
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:26,280
Audrow Nash: do that later kind
of sits on the back. And the

446
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,650
camera sits a bit further
forward, kind of on top of the

447
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,130
body.

448
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:35,340
Afreez Gan: Yeah, we also, we
also supplies a user guide for

449
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:39,780
the leader. And as a 3d camera
module, you also can look at our

450
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,810
guide, and now is only the basic
guide. And user can use our

451
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:52,620
guided tool, Ryan as the sensor.
But if a user wants to implement

452
00:38:52,620 --> 00:39:00,090
that some use case, they have to
study and implemented their use

453
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:00,480
case

454
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:05,850
Audrow Nash: themselves. Gotcha.
And so this is and it's running

455
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,180
the robot operating system or
ROS is it running ROS 1 or

456
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:09,870
ROS 2?

457
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:11,279
Afreez Gan: I just one

458
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:20,580
Audrow Nash: plus one. How did
so see? How did you decide to

459
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,590
Well, for us one was the
Stanford upper running was the

460
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:28,590
Stanford PACCAR running ROS 1
are you brought over ROS 1

461
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,830
for this and implemented or
found that one package that

462
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,350
worked really well? For the Lego

463
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,770
Afreez Gan: auction? Yeah, we've
built a real city environment.

464
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,090
That's our Pupper. Only is the
product leanings. Meaning so

465
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:42,480
ask.

466
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,280
Audrow Nash: Okay, so this was
you were saying you found that

467
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,550
one repository online that did a
lot of the legged locomotion for

468
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:59,580
you the control of the legs for
walking? And that was ROS 1

469
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:04,140
And then you've kind of Gotcha.
Do you have any plans on moving

470
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,440
to ROS to? Or is is ROS 1
the good one for now?

471
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:14,369
Afreez Gan: It was Ryan's work
very well now. But till we we

472
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:19,529
are also discussing on several
time how to update the tour ROS

473
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:27,749
to version. And we hope I think
I didn't need a lot of work to

474
00:40:28,169 --> 00:40:34,799
update updated. Yeah, and I
think we have still not very

475
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:41,999
clear plan to update two rows
for but we also, we also hope to

476
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:48,509
update. Maybe I hope we can
update the two rows to people

477
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:54,569
the end of this year. Yeah, we
can update this version in about

478
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:56,339
and I want that robot.

479
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:00,749
Audrow Nash: Yeah, it seems like
a lot of companies are kind of

480
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,749
feeling this pain of
transitioning from ROS, one to

481
00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:04,469
ROS to

482
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,180
Afreez Gan: Yeah.

483
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,610
Audrow Nash: There is something
if you use the Python client

484
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:19,500
library for ROS. One, there's a
thing that it's underscore ROS

485
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,970
py. And you can import it and it
just uses ROS to but it keeps

486
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,640
all the same ROS 1
interfaces. I thought that was

487
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,780
quite cool. Okay, I don't know
if that would ease the

488
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,930
transition. But there I don't
think there's a c plus, like, I

489
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:37,770
don't think there's a C Plus
Plus client library analog to

490
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:42,330
that at the moment. But it's a
cool idea to just switch it out.

491
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:46,830
So you can use it. And then you
can gradually replace things. As

492
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,550
you go from their

493
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:51,750
Afreez Gan: way I try our best
to move forward step by step.

494
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,670
But yeah.

495
00:41:55,530 --> 00:42:00,750
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Let's see.
So when a user orders one of

496
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:05,100
these mini poppers, it's a kit
and they have to assemble it

497
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,660
themselves. Is that correct?

498
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:18,420
Afreez Gan: Yeah, we we supply
several, several stos. One is

499
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:26,070
the basic Acade. You know, you
know, some, some some makers,

500
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,480
they already have their resume
bought, they don't want buy

501
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:37,500
additional box. So they only
want some some components. So

502
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,330
with supplies, the basic Okay,
and not include them. And then

503
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:49,020
some, I said I, I hope to buy
all the components, and I can

504
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:57,240
assemble it easily. Yeah,
sometimes. I hope by is a pre

505
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:02,520
assembled unit. And after I get
it, I can see jointer right now.

506
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:08,430
So actually, yeah, we supply
three eSkills.

507
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:15,599
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. That's
cool. And the body of it is 3d

508
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,229
printed. Right. And the legs as
well or several of the

509
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,179
components are 3d printed.
Right?

510
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:27,660
Afreez Gan: Yes, this is one of
the challenges for our, to our

511
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:38,700
product. Yeah. We are 3d
printed. You know, if you if you

512
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:44,580
only make a prototype, 3d
printed, there is no problem.

513
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:52,650
You can print it with several
hours or many hours. Yeah. If

514
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:59,370
you want to mass production, for
example, we I traveled to

515
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:08,370
shinjang. Our lender? I asked
them, I need several 1000 units.

516
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:18,750
3d printed, it is hard to find
is the vendor. Yeah. Wow.

517
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:25,409
Audrow Nash: So let's see. And
the trade off is that you can 3d

518
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:27,809
print and it's really good for
prototypes when you're doing

519
00:44:27,809 --> 00:44:32,759
like one here and one there and
learning. But mass production if

520
00:44:32,759 --> 00:44:37,349
you were gonna make 100,000 of
them, then you go and you get

521
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:40,949
the molds done. So you can like
cast the parts or something and

522
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:44,609
it's very efficient, but it's
very expensive upfront, right.

523
00:44:45,689 --> 00:44:50,609
But so that and many popper is
kind of in the middle where your

524
00:44:50,609 --> 00:44:55,409
volume is not incredibly large.
It's not like hundreds of 1000s

525
00:44:55,709 --> 00:45:00,539
It's like 1000s Perhaps. And so
that's why you're thinking 3d

526
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:00,899
print?

527
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:07,470
Afreez Gan: Yes. You know, for
for some part? Well, yeah,

528
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,030
you'll see for some yellow
pattern, they actually, at first

529
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:19,200
that house components are 3d
printed. And then it is harder

530
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:26,940
for us to find the vendor who
can supply so many 3d printed 3d

531
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:35,400
printed parts. So some of the
some of the path we actually now

532
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:41,280
is load from both. And that
sounds really balanced. Let's

533
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,330
Audrow Nash: see. Yeah, the
cost. And the end of the day.

534
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,700
Gotcha. And the so maybe for the
next model that you think will

535
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,320
come out, you said like June or
July or something, I think that

536
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,320
one, are you moving more and
more towards molds for

537
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,460
everything? Like, grab, try to
reuse as many of the pieces as

538
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:07,320
you are already having molds
for? And then eventually have it

539
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,700
be more? Yeah. So

540
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:15,059
Afreez Gan: we, yeah, we'll
reuse some sums and both paths?

541
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:23,639
Yeah. Yes, we have. Maybe our
natural working is, you'll see,

542
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:31,259
we can we can remove this path,
rest path. This path? Yeah, we

543
00:46:31,259 --> 00:46:36,359
can have a very good platform,
you can. So

544
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,150
Audrow Nash: if you remove kind
of a bump in the front, then you

545
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:43,020
can have a big flat space to put
sensors and whatever it is you

546
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:50,400
want. Yeah. Awesome. Let's see,
would you so we're touching on

547
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,850
it a little bit. Would you tell
me a bit about the manufacturing

548
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:57,120
process of this? And so you were
saying before we started

549
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,780
recording, you go down to
Shenzhen, and they work on like,

550
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:04,080
it's easy to prototype? And just
tell me a little bit about the

551
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,370
manufacturing down there?

552
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:16,110
Afreez Gan: That's yeah, you
know, yeah. First, we, it is not

553
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:23,940
easy. For the hardware. Hardware
device, especially and now was

554
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:32,430
now situation, you'll have to
you'll have to powerful supply,

555
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,250
supply chain capabilities.
Otherwise, you know, you're you

556
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:44,730
can talk as your opponent is a
good, but the coolest thing is,

557
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:53,970
actually I have several years of
hardware products. And I also

558
00:47:53,970 --> 00:48:01,920
have some resource supply chain
resource, so we can get get our

559
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:09,360
components. Yeah. Yeah, we also,
you know, we use the rest, Pat.

560
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,350
And there is also very hard to
get the book.

561
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,680
Audrow Nash: I've heard Yeah.
Yeah.

562
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,220
Afreez Gan: But we are so lucky.
And we were I'm wondering and

563
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:28,830
thinking about how, after our
campaign, and we have to prepare

564
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:36,000
the production, the most
important commodity is Rat Pack.

565
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:45,420
Before we can buy merch by
either name, and price, after

566
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:51,630
end of our campaign, it is hard
to get get as much fat. But we

567
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:59,730
are so lucky. And we bet Westpac
to like our product. Wonderful.

568
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:06,240
Yeah, we are so lucky. And so I
connected with Sylvester talking

569
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:12,780
about we needed less hype for
our product. And so, actually,

570
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:21,630
we've got enough respite from
from ROS back come there. UK.

571
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,640
Yeah. Okay, so

572
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:27,659
Audrow Nash: it's so funny.
Yeah, the part shortages have

573
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:31,229
been really tough, especially
for hardware companies. And

574
00:49:31,229 --> 00:49:34,589
especially like, I don't know, I
hear stories about companies

575
00:49:34,589 --> 00:49:38,819
ripping out Raspberry Pi's from
other devices so that they can

576
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:41,549
use them. So like buy a $200
thing and then rip out the

577
00:49:41,549 --> 00:49:45,509
Raspberry Pi, which was like $40
Before this whole supply

578
00:49:45,539 --> 00:49:50,459
shortage. Gotcha. So it's really
nice that you have the ability

579
00:49:50,459 --> 00:49:57,089
to keep getting Raspberry Pi's.
Let's see. And so

580
00:49:59,219 --> 00:50:03,149
Afreez Gan: here's a theory As a
manufacturer, the leading time

581
00:50:03,149 --> 00:50:06,899
is another risk because of

582
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:10,590
Audrow Nash: the waiting time,
so parts what is the leading

583
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:11,100
time

584
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:18,809
Afreez Gan: while the story is
at first we have to we have a

585
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:25,979
tool release also our device how
that came to our backers before

586
00:50:25,979 --> 00:50:36,179
the end of last year during
during I poacher our effect, I

587
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:42,839
also look at our factory last
year and push that progress. But

588
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:48,869
you know, last year shinjang as
COVID COVID-19 situation is not

589
00:50:48,869 --> 00:50:55,349
very good. And we already have
we have to delay a shipment. So

590
00:50:55,349 --> 00:51:02,099
it is it is very hard to
control. Accurate deadline for

591
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:02,879
the shipping for

592
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,790
Audrow Nash: the whole world.
Yeah, especially. I mean, it

593
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:09,840
touches so many places in so
many industries, the raspberry

594
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,270
pies, I don't know where they're
made, but you said it's a UK

595
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:16,290
company. And then you have the
Schengen area. And then there's

596
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:19,110
the whole global pandemic
situation, there's parts and

597
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:22,800
materials that need to come
together. So yeah, I could

598
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,280
imagine that it would be very
difficult to predict the lead

599
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,230
tie for all the parts.

600
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:34,740
Afreez Gan: Yeah, yeah.
fracture, I really hope many

601
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:41,490
thanks for many guys for Okay,
well give our madhhab ROS, a

602
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,640
Mac Suissa. Team give us and the
hardware.

603
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,470
Audrow Nash: What's the what's
the process when you go down to

604
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:57,030
Shenzhen? And you have an idea
that you want to get made? How

605
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:00,540
does it work? You go to
different companies and or

606
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:04,530
different factories and you say
I want to make this and then

607
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:07,320
they work out what they can do?
Or how does it work? How does it

608
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,780
work to manufacture something?

609
00:52:10,889 --> 00:52:16,559
Afreez Gan: Yeah, actually, it
is not a lot of hard work and

610
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:23,699
tissue work. Because if you know
you want to, for example, I was

611
00:52:23,789 --> 00:52:28,109
cutting myself, I don't know
first. Just terrible kind of

612
00:52:28,109 --> 00:52:37,079
work. But it is a to cannot work
best. So I just leave. I try to

613
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:42,479
leave a hotel very near that as
a satisfactory. I really, I went

614
00:52:42,479 --> 00:52:45,419
to their factory, and it works
out and then push them.

615
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,330
Audrow Nash: Oh, wow. That's
crazy. Yeah. Yeah, I

616
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:56,280
Afreez Gan: said, we have to
find a better solution for the

617
00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:02,820
better performance. At first it
is possible, but a real person

618
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:06,450
day and day. Finally, we found a
solution.

619
00:53:08,909 --> 00:53:13,169
Audrow Nash: I've heard that a
number of times where like, the

620
00:53:13,169 --> 00:53:17,219
CEO or CFO or whoever is
responsible for manufacturing

621
00:53:17,249 --> 00:53:20,969
will go and just basically stay
with the factory and keep

622
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:24,509
pushing them to try to make
refinements and improve the

623
00:53:24,509 --> 00:53:28,619
quality or get it to work in
some way. This kind of thing.

624
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:36,660
Afreez Gan: Yeah. You know, we
you know, we are a very small

625
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:44,400
startup company and before the
campaign layers. I was the only

626
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:52,080
guy the full time because other
guys I promise. And

627
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,340
Audrow Nash: how large are you
now?

628
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:58,620
Afreez Gan: Yeah. Now we have
several full time guys. Yeah.

629
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:02,160
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Several,
like five or several.

630
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:08,280
Afreez Gan: Right about Friday
for full time and several hours

631
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:08,970
that are part time.

632
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:10,980
Audrow Nash: Guys, gotcha.

633
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:12,929
Afreez Gan: We'll tell you about
10. Guys.

634
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,760
Audrow Nash: Yeah, about 10 guys
with full and part time I see.

635
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:27,660
Five Guys. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah,
that's it's, uh, you were the

636
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,620
only full time when? Before the
campaign and so the campaign.

637
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:35,490
That's a Kickstarter campaign
you're referring to, right?

638
00:54:36,449 --> 00:54:41,309
Afreez Gan: Yeah. Yes. That
campaign is not have a funny,

639
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:46,649
interesting story. And I would
love to hear that. But let me

640
00:54:46,649 --> 00:54:53,759
share your story. Here's our
last story. All right. Yeah, at

641
00:54:53,759 --> 00:55:01,169
first, you know, back to 2010.
Here we are. The term for the

642
00:55:01,169 --> 00:55:05,429
Pupper vendor, and a co worker
is anything how. And after we

643
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:11,069
release the Minipupper, a
Nathan Kao also told me Pupper

644
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:18,449
onto their staff at the Pupper
website. And I think maybe we

645
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:25,769
can seal or deliver Minipupper
just like snapper Pupper. They

646
00:55:25,769 --> 00:55:29,039
put that information on their
website. It was a category one,

647
00:55:29,489 --> 00:55:34,829
get a good visibility. Yeah,
they can send a mail and pay by

648
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:40,709
by paper or other online
payment. Yeah, so I have no, I

649
00:55:40,709 --> 00:55:47,009
have no any crowdfunding
campaign knowledge before.

650
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:54,269
Before Ming Pupper, but some
day, nice. And Tao said, why not

651
00:55:54,269 --> 00:56:03,269
try campaign? I said I have no
any background. Maybe it's

652
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:11,909
impossible or difficult for me.
So some days later, they say

653
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:17,249
send me a same method yet again.
And again. Why not try campaign?

654
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:25,709
I Sunday. Sunday I have was free
time. And two was was a media

655
00:56:25,709 --> 00:56:33,269
campaign. I started to study how
to make work campaign. Yeah.

656
00:56:33,539 --> 00:56:43,199
Yeah. So I'm not very clear. You
know, it's hard for me to make

657
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,159
it clear. And we I made a
decision to do a campaign. I

658
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:50,849
thought whatever the result,
issue shouldn't be very

659
00:56:50,999 --> 00:56:56,339
interesting. Another another
increase in DNS for me. So it is

660
00:56:56,819 --> 00:57:03,149
for sure. Yeah, if you decide to
campaign, you have to prepare

661
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:08,069
all kinds of lawyer all kinds of
lessons and prepare all kinds of

662
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:15,839
work. And I also double confirm
with some lenders or some

663
00:57:16,169 --> 00:57:24,449
friends, ask them what how to do
the campaign. Some questions you

664
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:31,649
can get to the answer easily
about the campaign process, by

665
00:57:31,649 --> 00:57:39,509
the some standard question is
not easy to find his answer.

666
00:57:39,809 --> 00:57:46,019
Because if you want to do the
campaign, you have to prepare

667
00:57:46,019 --> 00:57:54,899
the PR video, the Samza pictures
and the campaign pay design and

668
00:57:54,899 --> 00:58:02,129
all kinds of work. So at first,
we discussed with several

669
00:58:02,129 --> 00:58:10,199
vendors, how to do the PR video,
the if you have enough data, you

670
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:16,049
can do it and use it. And our
professional. Yeah, lots of

671
00:58:16,049 --> 00:58:20,309
professional team connect you
and then they can do the QA

672
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:27,089
video. But yeah, the budget is,
for example. 20k dollars. Yeah,

673
00:58:27,089 --> 00:58:31,469
but but not, but at that time at
the different code for me to

674
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:35,279
decide. Because it's a big
investment decide Yeah,

675
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,320
Audrow Nash: especially if it's
just you, for sure.

676
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:46,440
Afreez Gan: And the last we I
asked the my friends brain team

677
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:59,160
to take us to record a video.
But the unities is before before

678
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:05,130
one week before the campaign.
The guy who happened to make his

679
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:11,430
PR video heard his hand and he
cannot edit his video.

680
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:13,409
Audrow Nash: Oh, no way.

681
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:19,559
Afreez Gan: Yeah, we haven't
prepared the voice because we

682
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:25,679
have to prepare the video and
the voice. I lost that. Yeah, I

683
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:33,299
lost. I finished as laughter
snap finals. Voice and

684
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:43,229
integrators combines video and
audio. Yeah. Gotcha. Yeah. So a

685
00:59:43,229 --> 00:59:49,949
lot although the final PR video
is not so professional, but it

686
00:59:49,949 --> 00:59:56,699
can work it's quite another
Yeah, another another very

687
00:59:56,699 --> 01:00:02,549
interesting is you know if
you're a If you want to make a

688
01:00:02,549 --> 01:00:08,909
successful Kickstarter campaign
you will have to God's

689
01:00:11,129 --> 01:00:15,779
Kickstarter campaign official
platform project we love label.

690
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:27,029
Ah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. But even
but, you know, we I have no any

691
01:00:27,029 --> 01:00:34,229
other. No any I know how about
the campaign? The question for

692
01:00:34,229 --> 01:00:41,759
me is how to get the project
will have a label? I asked. I

693
01:00:41,759 --> 01:00:49,349
asked another guy hired me to do
the campaign. At first before,

694
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:57,299
even before was one week before
the campaign I asked him when we

695
01:00:57,299 --> 01:01:03,839
can't get as a project, we love
labor. He said, If your project

696
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:12,029
is good enough, you will get it.
Yeah. But this is a Das? Is that

697
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:18,209
the answer I want to get? So I
asked him Well, time and time

698
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:26,549
and time again. And it is harder
to have data that you like to

699
01:01:26,609 --> 01:01:33,839
answer. But I'm not alike. We
can just retweeting the labor so

700
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:40,139
I'll try to find the picture
campaign contact window and I

701
01:01:40,139 --> 01:01:45,239
want to African chrome with the
official contact window. So I

702
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:54,239
the last time that I found
contact window hazard here she

703
01:01:54,239 --> 01:02:01,409
is Heather and I was at design
tech category our pigs trap. And

704
01:02:03,299 --> 01:02:08,189
here's the icing I sent her a
male introduced our programming

705
01:02:08,189 --> 01:02:18,209
power project and how to book a
video conference. I remember one

706
01:02:18,899 --> 01:02:28,949
Saturday afternoon so before the
surprise happens our video

707
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:34,649
meeting is before the meet here
before the video meet him ice

708
01:02:34,649 --> 01:02:40,349
and we already may we already
made campaign paid but it is

709
01:02:40,889 --> 01:02:46,679
very rough. Very proper. The
video is not to the fixed

710
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:51,359
version. Some pictures are not
the fixed version looks not

711
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:52,469
good. And is

712
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:54,930
Audrow Nash: not very
professional. Yeah. The page

713
01:02:56,969 --> 01:03:02,579
Afreez Gan: actually looks bad.
Okay, but But before before the

714
01:03:03,899 --> 01:03:07,529
meeting with hedsor Western is a
meeting are we saying is

715
01:03:07,529 --> 01:03:13,919
appealing to her and introduce
our more information our me

716
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:19,199
Pupper our immediate
information. Our video is a

717
01:03:19,919 --> 01:03:27,179
Sunday afternoon. And we are
surprised and added that just

718
01:03:27,209 --> 01:03:33,359
the pneumonia we find our
project already has already give

719
01:03:33,419 --> 01:03:40,169
our valuable project we love the
labor. Very surprised. Yeah.

720
01:03:40,499 --> 01:03:41,039
Yeah.

721
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:44,519
Audrow Nash: That was so nice.
Very happy. Yeah, I would

722
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:44,999
imagine.

723
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:48,240
Afreez Gan: Yeah, very happy.
And the other week as a laborer.

724
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:54,060
I asked the guy who had who
support me to do the campaign.

725
01:03:56,250 --> 01:04:00,960
Yeah, I we already finished our
target that before the campaign

726
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:03,300
was our next target.

727
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:10,950
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Yeah. So
interesting. That's crazy. Yeah,

728

Afreez Gan: thank you. Thank
you. Another Yeah. Another

731
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:27,750
interesting is open CV open time
away. Branding team will also do

732
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:32,880
their Kickstarter campaign added
at a time away away, almost to

733
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,320
the campaign at the same time.

734
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,380
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Ah,

735
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:43,800
Afreez Gan: you could see his
brand name is Ken Scott is also

736
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,250
your

737
01:04:44,909 --> 01:04:47,429
Audrow Nash: local robotics.
Yeah. See, see

738
01:04:47,429 --> 01:04:50,459
Afreez Gan: traducida brand new
to me to link the US together.

739
01:04:50,909 --> 01:04:56,819
And wonderful. We are very close
to here wonderful. crew

740
01:04:56,969 --> 01:05:01,799
together, more and more deeply
and granted him are now have

741
01:05:01,889 --> 01:05:08,819
already failed at their Docker
Hub. Yeah, they have a we'll use

742
01:05:08,819 --> 01:05:14,219
our mean Pupper. And we will run
it together. Yeah. More in the

743
01:05:14,729 --> 01:05:15,149
pipeline.

744
01:05:17,609 --> 01:05:19,649
Audrow Nash: That'd be great.
What do you think? So you'll

745
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:25,019
work together? I guess where?
Where do you see many pupper?

746
01:05:25,019 --> 01:05:28,319
Going? So you already mentioned
that there's another version

747
01:05:28,499 --> 01:05:32,189
coming out? And you're putting
together the documentation?

748
01:05:32,489 --> 01:05:35,909
Where do you kind of see it
going? Maybe two to five years

749
01:05:36,029 --> 01:05:36,719
from now?

750
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:42,690
Afreez Gan: Yeah. In my dream,
we hope or we have a tool or

751
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:50,670
product line. Why is education
we really hope to release Good,

752
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:56,790
good, local data platform for
education. They're everywhere.

753
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:02,550
Not only universities, but also
middle school, high school

754
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:10,020
students and other any guys who
like as Loboda they can study

755
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:17,070
and enjoy as your product
product. And another product

756
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:24,000
line is the home robot. We hope
Yeah, we hope or we can release

757
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:32,670
useful and valuable and
acceptable home robot, home

758
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:38,730
robot we lag from global dark,
consumer, consumer double dark,

759
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:47,160
but you know, it is alien not do
that. Because we have to we have

760
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,100
to move forward carefully step
by step.

761
01:06:52,139 --> 01:06:54,809
Audrow Nash: What do you mean?
What? What are some of the

762
01:06:54,809 --> 01:06:59,609
obstacles that you must figure
out to move forward? For the

763
01:06:59,609 --> 01:07:00,719
consumer robot dog?

764
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:06,480
Afreez Gan: Yeah, for the
consumer of our dog, we have to

765
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:13,770
make it as a product. As simple
as possible. You know, if you

766
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:18,090
have some technical background,
we can we can discuss how to

767
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:23,550
calibration. But if for the
normal for the consumer product

768
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:30,390
that you you don't you cannot
say you cannot teach your

769
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,340
customers to calibrate

770
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:38,250
Audrow Nash: it. So it has to
have like one button like a

771
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:42,150
Roomba and then turn on and do
things and also has to be cheap

772
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:42,750
to

773
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:46,530
Afreez Gan: hear. Yeah, the
price is gonna be very cheap.

774
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:53,220
And as the function to the
various stable. Yeah, yes. We

775
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:58,980
hope we are trying our best
maybe because the end of this

776
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:05,910
year, maybe we can release our
consumer local Target prototype.

777
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:10,050
Maybe later this year, early
next year.

778
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:17,670
What do you think? Oh, go ahead.
Yeah, we have the study was that

779
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:19,440
year? Yeah. That a

780
01:08:21,329 --> 01:08:27,629
the real requirements from the
customers, you know, during our

781
01:08:27,629 --> 01:08:33,659
staff are probably released
about 580. device. And mini

782
01:08:33,659 --> 01:08:40,499
paper with we already released
about 2k. Wow, this wonderful

783
01:08:40,499 --> 01:08:47,909
device. Yeah. And our next
version I next. I mean, I named

784
01:08:47,909 --> 01:08:53,489
the mini Piper v2, we hope to
really say that the two outlier.

785
01:08:54,389 --> 01:08:59,039
And I hope we can release a
final sound in the outtakes of

786
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:04,649
the device. If you are released.
The more device the already is,

787
01:09:05,519 --> 01:09:11,069
the more feedback you can get.
Yeah, if you're not to the more

788
01:09:11,069 --> 01:09:15,839
feedback, you can make it up
better and better. Definitely,

789
01:09:15,869 --> 01:09:19,769
Someday, you'll find a consumer
solution.

790
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:25,110
Audrow Nash: Yes, it seems like
the Minipupper and Minipupper

791
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:32,310
v2. It's a smart way to one get
feedback as you're saying and to

792
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:35,610
grow the number of units that
you're making, because the

793
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:39,960
consumer one will probably be
fairly similar. And you can

794
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,960
refine the control algorithms
and you can refine everything

795
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:48,210
else about it. So it's a nice
way to go from a small market

796
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:52,560
that lets you keep growing to a
much bigger market to grow a lot

797
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,290
more, I think sounds like a good
plan

798
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:59,970
Afreez Gan: to make that fit.
Yeah, because such a very cool

799
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,820
Actually we Yeah, because we
actually we have we have not

800
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:12,690
much a Makita. To to try. We
have to areas them very

801
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:13,680
carefully. Yep.

802
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:19,380
Audrow Nash: I see, yes, it's a
very much taking what you have

803
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:22,560
getting a little more
reinvesting it back into your

804
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,320
company grow a little bit
bigger, and do the same thing,

805
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,500
grow, grow, grow, grow, until
eventually you can be a big

806
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:32,730
company. Ah, I hope to look back
in the future and see you guys

807
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:41,820
be enormous. And very successful
company. So with the consumer

808
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:47,010
robot dog that you're imagining,
what will it do? So is it is it

809
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:50,790
just gonna walk around? Is there
the the human interaction part

810
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:54,630
seems really difficult for that,
but what's going to be kind of

811
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,490
the thing that people buy it
for?

812
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:06,780
Afreez Gan: Ya got to dot your
point? Yeah. I was asked by many

813
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:14,700
guys the same question. Yeah,
yes. In my opinion, in my

814
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:22,530
opinion, it is. I think no one
can give a very clear answer.

815
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:31,140
For example, if that answer is
very clear. I think,

816
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,060
Audrow Nash: oh, everyone else
has already done.

817
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:40,530
Afreez Gan: Yeah, I think a
marketer is very clear. And as a

818
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:47,370
product feature is very clear.
We have no opportunity for the

819
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:56,850
startup company, the big company
will. But for me, I believe you

820
01:11:56,850 --> 01:12:01,950
can make it after three or five
years later. I think those are

821
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:08,850
the home home robot market that
will come. I believe it doesn't

822
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:15,150
matter what kind of a home robot
looks like. I believe he should

823
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:23,520
be as a lateral robot, but not
the wheel robot. So so so if the

824
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:29,820
if it is the leg robot, we can
we can immediately add a four

825
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:39,300
leg or two leg for now, maybe?
Finally. I think AI is used for

826
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:48,270
leg because it is more like two
animals. Yes. So yeah, I believe

827
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:54,450
was the maintenance. So we, we
moved with their target stamp I

828
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:59,490
stamp. But I did that first.
Maybe in the end of this year or

829
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:06,480
early next year, our first home
robot prototype, or maybe you

830
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:15,210
can think that it is a mobile
smart speaker on mobile. Yeah.

831
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:15,690
Yep.

832
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:20,040
Audrow Nash: Kind of like Amazon
is doing and a lot of these

833
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:27,780
other companies. Gotcha. Yeah,
and legs. I mean, like carpet is

834
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:30,510
not a problem if you have to
like step up onto the carpet or

835
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:33,990
stairs or anything. Like if you
have a legged robot, there's a

836
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:39,300
lot of advantages for getting
around the home. Especially if

837
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:43,050
it's a consumer products, like
you buy a Roomba. And it can't

838
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:47,280
go in the like little dip in the
living room or something like

839
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:51,180
this that has a stair to editor,
whatever it might be. So legs

840
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:55,320
clearly have those advantages.
Four versus two is an

841
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:58,410
interesting discussion for is a
lot easier, I think as a

842
01:13:58,410 --> 01:14:01,680
roboticist because you can be
passively stable at anytime

843
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:04,980
because you can have three
points of contact or this kind

844
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,750
of thing. Yeah.

845
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:14,220
Afreez Gan: Yeah, you'll think
maybe five or 10 years later, a

846
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:20,070
few days. Home robot with four
leg you may be feel very good.

847
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:23,430
It is like animals, but maybe
you will find as they are two

848
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:28,320
leg like a human in your home.
Maybe it is not feel better.

849
01:14:29,489 --> 01:14:31,169
Audrow Nash: It's like a little
human. Yeah, it's a little

850
01:14:31,169 --> 01:14:35,669
stressful. I could see that. I
wonder I mean, birds birds have

851
01:14:35,669 --> 01:14:40,049
two legs, also. So like chickens
and things like this. And we're

852
01:14:40,049 --> 01:14:42,779
not terribly intimidated by
them. But I think a chicken

853
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:46,859
shaped robot would be very
funny. Like it's not a design

854
01:14:46,859 --> 01:14:52,289
that I see. I think ever but
yeah, I see what you mean. And

855
01:14:52,289 --> 01:14:56,309
then also easier to manufacture
probably point like feet are

856
01:14:56,309 --> 01:15:00,959
really hard as far as I
understand for you like buy big

857
01:15:01,529 --> 01:15:07,679
needle robots? Because like, a
lot easier with like sore

858
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:09,839
points, like you're doing with
Minipupper?

859
01:15:11,849 --> 01:15:16,379
Afreez Gan: Yeah, the most of
the most time consuming data

860
01:15:16,379 --> 01:15:26,669
users use lag. Yeah. Here, yeah,
we have a tool. Now what I need,

861
01:15:26,669 --> 01:15:33,659
I still need about three hours
to assemble it, and additional

862
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:39,629
half an hour to calibration it.
And our next version all my

863
01:15:39,629 --> 01:15:45,359
Takita is Katherine was, you
know, I need more than three

864
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:46,979
hours to assemble it.

865
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:48,750
Audrow Nash: And you've done a
lot of that's yeah.

866
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:54,840
Afreez Gan: But other customers
maybe need more time to assemble

867
01:15:54,840 --> 01:16:02,940
and enjoined? Yeah, one extra
version? I hope the assemble. We

868
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:09,450
can assemble it within one hour.
And don't need to any more

869
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:13,380
calibration. Any maybe the auto
calibration?

870
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:20,790
Audrow Nash: That would be nice.
Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. Bigger

871
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:24,000
Picture. I'd love to so
segwaying a little bit. I would

872
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,720
love to hear your because I
mean, I'm in the United States.

873
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:30,300
I would love to hear your
impression of kind of the

874
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:33,960
robotics industry in China. And
the manufacturing is very

875
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:38,880
interesting. So like, I don't
know, how do you how do you

876
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:39,480
think of it?

877
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:45,150
Afreez Gan: You me as a robot I
manufacture?

878
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:49,230
Audrow Nash: Yes. In the
Schengen area, and then around

879
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:54,030
China? Just yeah. I don't know
how, like for the whole robotics

880
01:16:54,030 --> 01:16:59,280
field, how how do we how can we
think of Shin Jen? And? I don't

881
01:16:59,280 --> 01:16:59,550
know.

882
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:05,880
Afreez Gan: Yeah, I think,
shouldn't they, the supply chain

883
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:12,390
is a huge one for us in general.
And you can find all kinds of

884
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:21,390
vendors. And they can't give you
some solution. But if you want

885
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:28,500
to do some innovation, you have
to you have to design the

886
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:33,570
Pycelle you can find all kinds
of solutions. The common

887
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:37,020
solution, it is easy to find a
common solution in ancient in

888
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:43,530
Makeda, and a winner. But if you
want to make some innovation

889
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:47,010
product, or you have to design
it myself.

890
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:52,890
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Gotcha. And
so if you do design it, oh, go

891
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:53,190
ahead.

892
01:17:54,840 --> 01:18:01,020
Afreez Gan: I mean, if you
review, product, manufacture a

893
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:07,710
common hardware device, it is
very easy. Because it certainly

894
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:09,570
is a very convenient.

895
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:15,330
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So if you
say you do come up with

896
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:18,840
something new like you with your
servo motors that are a little

897
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:22,560
different than what's been done
or maybe I don't know anything

898
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,790
else that's new. How does it
work? To get a factory in

899
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:33,660
Shenzhen? Making it like do you
have to work with them a lot? Do

900
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:36,210
you kind of give them what you
need? And they'll figure it out?

901
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:38,970
Or how does it work? Yeah.

902
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:48,960
Afreez Gan: Yes, about you can
also find many vendors initially

903
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:56,640
market and during a tutorial
deliver staff at a Pupper, I

904
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:03,930
already know some sub so
vendors. So we asked them one by

905
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:10,500
one and compare their service
and as a technology background,

906
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:16,080
and their selectors. The better
battle rounds and then to

907
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:23,520
discuss to to give give them our
detailed requirement and discuss

908
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:28,860
our solution discusses the
solutions maybe, you know, as

909
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:32,850
the forecast. Now the fourth
category is to not match and

910
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:41,700
you'll need I didn't not a very
easy to to push them to some

911
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,420
ketema Yep.

912
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:49,140
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Unless
you're making I don't know a

913
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:52,560
million of them or some crazy
number. That it's really worth

914
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,280
it for them to customize. This
kind of thing. Yes, yeah.

915
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,970
Afreez Gan: Yeah, yeah, I want
an extra wash. I will resist

916
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,400
that serves, because, you know,
if you're wanting to do some

917
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:10,680
innovation or some big change,
to make it simple, you will have

918
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:15,000
to redesign some, some key
components.

919
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:22,680
Audrow Nash: Yep. Gotcha. How,
how is the I mean, this kind of

920
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:26,520
two questions. How are you guys
funded? And how is the investor

921
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,470
climate in China to you?

922
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:41,640
Afreez Gan: Okay, so the first
question is, how to get the data

923
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:41,910
right?

924
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,890
Audrow Nash: For you, so are you
are you bootstrapping Are you

925
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:49,860
putting your own money in and
are you accepting investment

926
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:54,240
from people from? Are you
locally funded? Does the

927
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:58,110
government help with your
funding? Or I'm just wondering

928
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:02,550
how the funding so far so are
you guys

929
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:10,860
Afreez Gan: different? i Let's
go back to Stanford as a

930
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:14,700
Stanford a paracord project. And
at first saw it I used my own

931
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:21,150
money to buy all the components
about Africa and and they enjoy

932
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:27,930
it and Alaska, i becomes the
vendor of the temple Pupper and

933
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:34,680
the bigger because after we said
rotis castle with Nathan Kao by

934
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:40,530
mail or videoconference, Nathan
asked me whether it is possible

935
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:46,800
to supply as a kid from China
marketer because China supply

936
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:53,640
chain is convenient and as the
price is, is lower. So I look

937
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:58,560
around and all the components
from the Kenya market and

938
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:03,570
deliver a stamp or the Pupper
with with low price. But

939
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:12,270
frankly, speaking of the day,
the some profit after deliver

940
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:20,550
several hundreds of staff for
the Pupper project we got we got

941
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:29,040
some profit. And I use a profit
to developer Minipupper. So

942
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:35,010
yeah, so when the Pupper
campaign after the campaign, we

943
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:43,170
got much more funding. And then
we use that money to developer

944
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:53,880
our next version. So Ron and Rob
Yep. Actually, now or now. Now

945
01:22:53,910 --> 01:23:04,890
it is. I I didn't actually i not
i did not use the notch in my

946
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:05,490
own money.

947
01:23:06,930 --> 01:23:11,430
Audrow Nash: In the latest mini
popper? Yeah, yeah. Nice. That's

948
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:16,290
great. Let's see. And then, um,
do you think going forward? Will

949
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:21,900
you take investor money or try
to bootstrap the whole time and

950
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:22,830
keep becoming?

951
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:29,490
Afreez Gan: Yes. We have as a
plan to get investment maybe

952
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:37,920
later this year. And we are so
lucky. And we actually now we

953
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:46,800
already got to the incubator
wacky incubator program approval

954
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:52,230
in Hong Kong. Congrats. Yeah,
they will. Yeah. They will give

955
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:59,520
us some support and not only
offers some funding, but also,

956
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:07,590
you know, in Hong Kong. The VC
environment is very, very

957
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:14,940
convenient. Yeah. Yeah, well, we
can. Yeah, well, I hope we can

958
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:21,000
get our first round an investor
later this year, and then we can

959
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:28,800
use the fun to to look more.
More technical guys, and

960
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:32,640
accelerator our, our rd and
marketing.

961
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:40,770
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Yeah. Let's
see. So beginning to wrap up.

962
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:47,400
What do you think? What do you
think robotics will look like?

963
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:53,520
Going forward? So the next like
two to five years. Where do you

964
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,290
think we'll be in robotics?

965
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:02,670
Afreez Gan: Yeah, I'm very
positive. Go to the robotics

966
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:11,010
market. And you know, now,
vision technology, speak as a

967
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:18,660
voice or re as maker Ria, voice
technology. There are many, many

968
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:25,080
solutions. And I think that we
are already ready. The only need

969
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:34,770
the only thing we need to do is
how to combine all kinds of all

970
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:40,320
kinds of functions or
technologies into a total

971
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:44,520
product require the product, and
they release it to the customer

972
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:51,750
with acceptable price, and
variable use aka. And I think

973
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:57,270
I'm very positive, but I think
maybe within five years, three

974
01:25:57,270 --> 01:26:01,980
or five years later, I think
most people will see more and

975
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:08,700
more robot products. And I also
believe, within three years we

976
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:16,980
we can release as home robot top
consumer product will be sold in

977
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:24,900
no time, but some company will
release it. Okay. Well,

978
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:27,120
Audrow Nash: I hope it's you
guys. Fingers crossed for it.

979
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:33,960
Yeah, let's see. So we're
wrapping up. Is there any links

980
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:37,440

you'd like to share with our

981
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:43,950
watchers and listeners? Yeah.
All right.

982
01:26:44,010 --> 01:26:47,430
Afreez Gan: Also, talk a minute
and a resource of Amitabha is

Link? I think you can get all

984
01:26:55,170 --> 01:26:58,980
