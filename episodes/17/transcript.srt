1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,489
Audrow Nash: This is a
conversation with Dayo McIntosh,

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,289
who is the CEO and founder of
Yateou. Yateou is an early stage

3
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:13,259
startup that makes wellness
products and has a customer

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,339
facing robot ADE, that
personalizes customer orders.

5
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:21,479
One thing that I found cool
about Yateou is that they put it

6
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:25,859
on a truck that's kind of like a
big food truck that has a big

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,849
window so that customers can see
it working to make a customized

8
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,019
order. It's an interesting way
to draw people in so that Yateou

9
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:37,319
can start a conversation with
them about wellness, which is

10
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:41,969
where Diana's interest in the
idea started. I enjoyed talking

11
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,329
to Dayo to hear about her
experience with Yateou. Her

12
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,199
background is in robotics. So
it's interesting to hear about

13
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:53,309
how she came to using her robot
arm ADE, as well as hearing

14
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,519
about the challenges she's
encountered to get to where she

15
00:00:56,519 --> 00:01:02,489
is, such as having her truck
with the robot stolen. And it's

16
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,449
also interesting to hear about
the clever things that she's

17
00:01:06,449 --> 00:01:11,339
doing to manage the complexity
in her growing new business. I'm

18
00:01:11,339 --> 00:01:15,299
Audrow Nash. This is the sense
think act podcast. Thank you to

19
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,969
our founding sponsor open
robotics. If you enjoy this

20
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:21,719
interview, please consider
subscribing. And now here's my

21
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,149
interview with Dayo. Hi, Dayo,
would you introduce yourself?

22
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,050
Dayo McIntosh: Hi, Audrow My
name is Dayo G. McIntosh,

23
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,510
and I'm the founder and CEO of
Yeto.

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,000
Audrow Nash: Would you tell me
about Yateou?

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,080
Dayo McIntosh: Yes, yeah, so is
this sustainable clean beauty

26
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,790
and wellness brand. We create
products that are all natural

27
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,120
vegan, cruelty free and
ethically sourced. And the

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,840
unique thing about what we do is
that we've incorporated robotics

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,900
to bring that technology front
and center to the beauty and

30
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,950
wellness industries.

31
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,020
Audrow Nash: And how do you use
robots?

32
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,510
Dayo McIntosh: So right now we
have our essential oil

33
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:10,710
mixologist robot called ADE.
ADE is the first consumer

34
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,920
facing robot for the beauty and
wellness industries. And

35
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,630
currently we have ADE stationed
in a moving truck, making it

36
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,600
mobile so we take Addie to
different events, markets and

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,190
things like that. And people can
interact and interface directly

38
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,170
with ADE to create customized
and personalized personal care

39
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,860
and wellness products. Gotcha.
What,

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,120
Audrow Nash: what does it look
like?

41
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:43,769
Dayo McIntosh: Addie is a Kuka
robot. It is about two feet

42
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:49,349
tall. And it's a manipulator.
It's an arm. It's a robotic arm.

43
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,689
And again, it sits in a truck
with a transparent glass that

44
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:59,939
people can see. See and watch
ADE in action.

45
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,359
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So you said
Abby, Eddie's the next

46
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:06,749
mixologist. What does that mean?
What does that actually doing?

47
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,840
Dayo McIntosh: So similar to a
bartender, right? We have ADE

48
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,570
going to different dispensing
vats to create products, again,

49
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:25,050
tailored to each individual
person's like personal care and

50
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,790
wellness goals. And once. So for
example, we have an interface

51
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,030
and someone like you would go up
to the interface, for example, a

52
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,790
screen a tablet, and say, hey, I
want to mix this ingredient with

53
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,730
this ingredient. And I want it
to smell like this. And that

54
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,820
would kick it into gear. And
that's how we create

55
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,990
personalized products.

56
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,330
Audrow Nash: Super cool. So for
this, is there any like? So if I

57
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,620
say my skin is super dry, and I
want it to smell like oranges,

58
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,100
or something like this? Does it?
Does Addie come up with a recipe

59
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,760
or dive to say I want to this
much I don't know, shea butter

60
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,420
in it or this much whatever. How
does that work? Is it

61
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,180
recommended based on goals? Or
is it like I know the

62
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,930
ingredients.

63
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:17,219
Dayo McIntosh: So the full
picture, the full rein skill of

64
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:22,499
this is to have give consumers
the options to customize and mix

65
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:25,619
and match however they want. But
rolling out we're going to start

66
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:30,149
out with pre made orders that
people can adjust. So it's more

67
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:33,809
of an adjustment than a full
blown customization feature.

68
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,240
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Oh, gotcha.
And how does so for ADE to do

69
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,620
its mixologist work? How does
Addie actually go to the

70
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,880
dispensers or other dispensers
robotic to does that he push

71
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,180
into something and it comes out
like a soap container or how

72
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,750
does it work?

73
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,470
Dayo McIntosh: So the dispensers
are not robotic. So they are

74
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:02,400
actually wine bottles that we've
added dispenser or would you

75
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,320
call it droppers to them sort of
thing. And the idea behind that

76
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,800
is that we wanted to eliminate
as much or I wanted to eliminate

77
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,020
as many possible holdups by
limiting the number of

78
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:23,640
automations or automated pieces
we had in this operations. So

79
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,690
ADE is the only robotic
automated piece in this whole

80
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,480
setup, and it goes to each
bottle depending on what you

81
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,050
select and pushes up on the
dispensing nozzle, that's what I

82
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,650
was looking for pushes up on the
nozzle, and that releases a set

83
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,820
amount of liquid ingredients for
the product.

84
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:43,679
Audrow Nash: So it's kind of
like one of those soap

85
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:46,319
dispensers and restrooms where
you you push the thing and a

86
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,129
little bit comes out

87
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:49,919
Dayo McIntosh: exactly, it's
exactly like that, or something

88
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,499
you'd see at a bar, for example,
I don't know if you've seen

89
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:56,759
those. Those dispenser actually,
I think they have them now at

90
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,279
home, like you have those mobile
bars that you can install in

91
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,549
your kitchen. And they all have
like nozzles that you attach to

92
00:06:05,549 --> 00:06:11,069
the bottom of, of Yeah, like a
cocktail bottle or liquor

93
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:13,769
bottle, and then you just push
up on that, and then you get

94
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:14,339
what you want.

95
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,450
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. And then
how do you how do you control

96
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,560
Addie? For this? So does it does
that he know the position of all

97
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,200
of the different ones. And you
can say option one, option two

98
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,170
option, it will go push option
one, option two, option three.

99
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,020
Dayo McIntosh: That's exactly
how it's set up. Yes. And

100
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,260
currently it is not fully
automated. And that's what I'm

101
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,300
working towards. So for the time
being, we use the Teach pendant,

102
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,870
what we call a teach pendant.
It's sort of like a controller.

103
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,340
So think of like a game, a game
controller, for example that you

104
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:53,400
use to with your console. So
instead of that, like we have

105
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,750
this teach pendant, and I can
call out the different positions

106
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,050
that I want ADE to visit with
the Teach pendant, and that

107
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,070
keeps adding together.

108
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,400
Audrow Nash: So how does the
Teach pendant what I'm imagining

109
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,330
is like a big pen kind of thing
with maybe like a bunch of QR

110
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,780
tags or some some fiducial
markers on top and you like hold

111
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,030
it into a spot and there's a
camera looking at it and you

112
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,210
click it or something? And it
says okay, here is the location

113
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,830
I want? Or is that how it works?

114
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,450
Dayo McIntosh: No, think of a
really industrial looking

115
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,500
tablet. Oh, okay. So that's
exactly what the Teach pendant

116
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,840
is the controller. And so like,
on this tablet, we have all the

117
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,670
different programs, we have
different positions. And if I

118
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:44,070
want it to go to bottles one and
seven, I enter that into the

119
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,560
Teach pendant on to the Teach
candidate and make that

120
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:54,150
selection and click press or go
play. And that again. gets it

121
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,480
going.

122
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,080
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So you
select all of the things you

123
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,340
want it to do on this. Exactly.
It's like I want I want it to go

124
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,270
to one and seven, whatever. And
then it will grab the bottle,

125
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,210
bring it over there. How do you
get it to know the initial

126
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:13,320
positions of the bottles where
it has to push to get the stuff?

127
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,720
Dayo McIntosh: I'm sorry? Can
you how do we?

128
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,410
Audrow Nash: So if you if you
have all the dispensers up? How

129
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,160
do you? So if you add a new
dispenser to the right, say a

130
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,820
bit further away? How would you
tell it that there's one over

131
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,360
there that it could go push for
option 10? Say

132
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,370
Dayo McIntosh: so right now
everything is controlled, we

133
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,120
have a limited amount of
dispensers, we have 20 of them.

134
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:40,800
So 20 positions that are set. So
if we're introducing a new

135
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,490
ingredient, we're taking
something else out. So like it

136
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,580
doesn't go beyond the set
parameters that we have in place

137
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,930
right now. And

138
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,160
Audrow Nash: warming up for the
first ones. So for all 20 of

139
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,430
those. How did you tell Addie
all those positions.

140
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,480
Dayo McIntosh: Um, so that was
programmed. We programmed it.

141
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,310
And I worked with engineers to
come up with a programming for

142
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,620
this. And so that was hard
coded. Yeah. And so adding those

143
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:17,520
position one is, you know, to
disagree. Yes. Away from Me. And

144
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,480
yeah, so you can get to all
those positions. Without knowing

145
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,390
what exactly is there, right.
It's just going to position.

146
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,590
Audrow Nash: Yep. And how does
so if you want to do you want to

147
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:33,300
make a custom mix for someone?
Is it kind of like these

148
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,560
different dispensers will top
off the bottle. So you have

149
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,140
like, maybe you can pick the
framework fragrance and that's

150
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:45,120
like one dispenser, and you can
add some extra attribute like

151
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,230
extra moisturizing or whatever
it might be. And that makes it a

152
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,190
little bit custom but is it
largely made already, and you're

153
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,780
just adding like a little
topping to it.

154
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,920
Dayo McIntosh: Exactly. It's
largely made already and what

155
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,250
we're working on right now So
you can make adjustments to the,

156
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,570
to the recipe.

157
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:10,980
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Very cool.
Yeah. So and then this is all in

158
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,030
a truck, and that truck has a
big sheet of glass. So you can

159
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,270
look and watch the robots
working. Can you tell me a bit

160
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:18,840
about that?

161
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,640
Dayo McIntosh: Yes. So when I
set out the goal, and again, the

162
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,590
vision still for this is to be
in a brick and mortar store, to

163
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,110
be sort of like the central
point where people can come

164
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:37,800
together. And it's going to be a
safe place for self discovery

165
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,730
for exploration, like finding
clean, natural ingredients and

166
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,930
products that work for your
hair, skin and wellness in

167
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,650
general. And so that was the
goal. But living in the Bay

168
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,620
Area, we all know that real
estate here is really expensive.

169
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,750
And so when that didn't seem
feasible, I had to think outside

170
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,080
the box, and that's where the
idea of the trucking came about,

171
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,130
I really liked the idea of
having this experience, right,

172
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,910
we're building this experience
for people that will sort of

173
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,760
engage them and get the
conversation going about what

174
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,810
they're using, in their, like,
on their bodies, for example,

175
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,210
and what their overall personal
care and wellness like regimen.

176
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,820
Resume is. And so that was the
idea behind this. So you walk up

177
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,640
to the truck and and immediately
you get this experience, right,

178
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,330
you're walking up and right in
front of us is robots, you know,

179
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,180
working to create a product
tailored for you.

180
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,020
Audrow Nash: And so the way that
it looks for the customer is

181
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,870
they come up to you and your
truck or whoever you're working

182
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,070
for it. And then they talk to
you for a little bit and then

183
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,640
you poke on your teach pendant
or whatever you call it a

184
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,590
tablet. Yes. And then do you do
you hand ADE a bottle? Does

185
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,930
that ego pick one up? Or how
does it work?

186
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,140
Dayo McIntosh: So right now we
have it set have different

187
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,030
trees, the different bottle
sizes in the truck. So when we

188
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,060
make the selection, it knows
what bottle to go to based on

189
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,180
what we've selected. So if we
pick a small bottle, it will go

190
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,370
to tray one. Medium bottle tree
two, large bottle tray three.

191
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,940
And so that's how it's currently
set up. Yes. So we don't do any

192
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,460
of the like handling of bottles
or ingredients like everything

193
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,000
is housed again in the truck.
And ADE manages that whole

194
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,990
setup. So the same?

195
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,500
Audrow Nash: How does that he
pick up the bottle? Because that

196
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,270
seems like a kind of tough task.
So you have some sensors, like

197
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,480
you have a camera or some sort
of like physical sensors or

198
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,220
something for telling where the
bottles are?

199
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,790
Dayo McIntosh: Or how do you
know. So that's something that

200
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,300
we're putting into place. But
right now, everything is hard

201
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:57,300
coded. So we can't afford to,
you know, move anything. So

202
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,500
those trays are bolted into the
ground so that regardless of

203
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,830
where we go with the trust, like
nothing moves, and so that

204
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:09,180
position is always constant. So
it always knows if they want a

205
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,080
small bottle, I go to this
position. Open up my gripper and

206
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,520
there's going to be something
there for me.

207
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,460
Audrow Nash: Yeah, but so
getting a bottle on a tray. The

208
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,970
tray is fixed, but like it has a
bunch of bottles on it. Correct?

209
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:27,660
How does it go and grab a bottle
on a fixed tray? Is it just you

210
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,730
have like a bunch of bottles
sitting in kind of like, I don't

211
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,730
know, separate sections for each
bottle and it goes in it knows

212
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,860
that this one is empty. Now it
goes to the next one.

213
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,090
Dayo McIntosh: How does it sell
a bottle? So everything that

214
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,090
we've done right now has been
like really rudimentary, right?

215
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,190
eliminating any, any potential?
Yes, any uncertainty or any

216
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,710
Audrow Nash: possibility of
vacation for small, medium and

217
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,660
large and you replace it every
time or

218
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,810
Dayo McIntosh: Yes. So we have a
long tray and I feed in the

219
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,510
bottles or whoever feeds in the
bottles. And then we have it on

220
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,870
an incline. So whenever ADE
grabs up, it slides down.

221
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,780
Exactly, exactly. It's clever.
Yeah.

222
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,620
Audrow Nash: I really liked the
approach you're taking, which is

223
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,970
like, keep the problem as simple
as possible, because you can

224
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,940
always grow and there's no need
to like automate everything,

225
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,450
especially while you're testing
out an idea. Right. And so I

226
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,940
really like it that it's so
clever because you have three

227
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,460
spots and the bottles just slide
down into it.

228
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,130
Dayo McIntosh: Exactly. So one
of my biggest fear when I

229
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,210
started doing this, I did a lot
of research about a lot of like

230
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:37,830
consumer facing robotic
applications, right. And I found

231
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:42,060
that the number one problem that
customers or people seem to

232
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:48,600
speak about was that these
different applications they were

233
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,200
always down like they weren't.
They weren't working. They

234
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,820
weren't working often. And the
problem with that is if you have

235
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,630
so many are different stations
that are all automated If you

236
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,350
run the risk of like one or the
other going down, and so you're

237
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,860
constantly fixing a problem. And
so when I set out to do this, I

238
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,670
wanted to simplify it as much as
possible, again to begin with

239
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,900
and figure out the rest as we,
as we grow as we as we move

240
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:22,200
forward. And so like everything
is super simple. What I'm

241
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,740
building right now, yeah, yeah,
it's it's been good so far.

242
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,330
Audrow Nash: And how so Okay,
now ADE has picked up a bottle

243
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,050
from one of a set of spots. So
you say a small medium or a

244
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,830
large bottle, or whatever the
sizes are, she grabs one, and

245
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,740
then pushes and adds a few
different things from the

246
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,300
dispensers. I assume the bottles
have no tops. Yes, correct. So

247
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,980
you can squirt right into it.
And then does ADE like, is

248
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,470
there like a little door or
something where ADE puts the

249
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,140
bottle for you to give it to the
customer? Or how does that like

250
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,430
the whole process now?

251
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,480
Dayo McIntosh: Okay, so let's
say you walk up to the truck,

252
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:05,130
you're like, Hey, do I want this
product. And I wanted this way,

253
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,720
I input that selection onto the
Teach pendant that keeps adding

254
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,880
together, it moves over to the
trays with the with the product

255
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,710
bottles grabs a bottle, small,
medium, or large, takes that and

256
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:24,690
goes to the dispensers on the
wall. So if you selected product

257
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,140
number one and seven, for
example, it would go to product

258
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,550
one, or dispenser one dispenser
seven. And once that's done

259
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:36,840
dispensing, it would deliver the
bottle to two cutouts that we

260
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,860
have in the truck. So in the
truck we have we cut out two

261
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:47,880
doors, think of it as a trap
door, two doors with a revolving

262
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:53,370
revolving tray. So as you would
place the bottle on the tray on

263
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,850
the inside of the truck, we
would revolve that tray and it

264
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,190
would appear on the outside of
the truck for the customer to

265
00:16:59,190 --> 00:16:59,490
grab.

266
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,460
Audrow Nash: Cool. Okay. So,
with this, how long have you

267
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,740
been doing this? So how long
have you had the truck setup

268
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:07,890
with?

269
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:13,619
Dayo McIntosh: Ooh, two years.
Two years? A little over two

270
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:20,999
years? Yeah. So we started doing
our beta and showcasing it in q4

271
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:27,029
of 2019. And then, as we all
know, COVID hit right, the next

272
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:30,989
year. And so all of that
shutdown. And actually it was

273
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:35,399
stolen. And so that set us back.
And so we've been in the process

274
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:39,779
of like rebuilding. So that, you
know, as things have opened back

275
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:42,689
up, we can get back out there.
I'm showcasing and doing what we

276
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:42,989
do.

277
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,059
Audrow Nash: So you don't
currently have an Audi

278
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:48,479
replacement ADE.

279
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,640
Dayo McIntosh: Yeah, it's a
funny story. So now I currently

280
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,870
have two ADDYs. So the original
ADE was still the truck was

281
00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:01,140
stolen with Abby. Yeah, they
It's wild. They ended up

282
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:08,460
destroying the truck. Taking the
computer, the brains behind it.

283
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,020
So it is a manipulator, right.
It's just the arm, the hardware,

284
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,620
and then you have the controller
the brains behind it. So they

285
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,090
took that I'm guessing they took
it for the wires. So that was

286
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,440
missing. And so I have to start
over purchasing you ADE. And so

287
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,580
now I just have the manipulator
the arm for the first one.

288
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,190
Audrow Nash: That's crazy. I
can't believe just how did they

289
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,400
steal your truck? With this? Did
it like at night? You just found

290
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,670
your truck missing or Yeah, kind
of thing? Are you in the Oakland

291
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,510
area? Or were

292
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,830
Dayo McIntosh: you? No, I'm
actually I would consider this

293
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,030
the suburbs. I live in New work
close to Fremont and just across

294
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:57,090
the bridge from like Menlo Park
and Palo Alto. So yeah, that

295
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,760
that was devastating. Yeah, like
I said, it was right before the

296
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,500
lockdown. So no one was working.
Everything was shut down. And so

297
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,740
we just started rebuilding at
the end of last year.

298
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:13,949
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. I just had
a friend who had his car stolen,

299
00:19:13,949 --> 00:19:18,509
and they just found it recently
been so crazy that

300
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,550
Dayo McIntosh: it is. Yeah.

301
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:23,039
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Your robot
truck.

302
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,030
Dayo McIntosh: And my robot
truck. Yeah, like a whole truck.

303
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,460
I was like, how do you steal a
whole truck? But yeah, that

304
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,030
happened. So it's part of the
year two story.

305
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:39,839
Audrow Nash: Gosh, now, so two
years a lot. Some have some

306
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,099
difficulties with like the truck
being stolen and COVID. But how

307
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:48,539
have customers been engaging
with ADE and how has the

308
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,759
experience been and the times
that you have been in front of

309
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:51,239
people?

310
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,670
Dayo McIntosh: So um, so we
debuted ADE unofficially at

311
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:02,520
Afro tech. So the time which is
November berth 2019, it was just

312
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,690
a really great opportunity to,
like, showcase Addie, and have a

313
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,840
crowd of people where we could
get feedback and just kind of

314
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,630
gauge people's reactions. And so
that was a really awesome

315
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,940
experience, we got a lot of
feedback, we got a lot of

316
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,840
interest. And we were really
excited to launch after that,

317
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,990
based on the interest and the
excitement that we found, or

318
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:31,830
that we received, being at that
event. And yeah, so it just,

319
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,190
again, all of that, the lock
downs, the theft, all of that

320
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,280
set us back, but we're gearing
up again, to go back out there.

321
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,550
And we know that we're going to
have the same amount of like

322
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,300
excitement and interest that we
had initially. So that's what

323
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,030
motivates us to keep going. And
that's what we're looking

324
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:48,510
forward to.

325
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:52,529
Audrow Nash: And the any like
funny stories about people being

326
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:55,829
just like, thrilled or anything
when the robot gives them their

327
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:58,919
custom product or anything.

328
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,490
Dayo McIntosh: So when we
launched, we weren't actually or

329
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,580
when we did our beta back then
we weren't actually in

330
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:11,010
operation. So everything is just
like, online right now. You can

331
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:16,620
buy premade products online, but
we haven't actually ever started

332
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:22,350
selling via adding those
evolving demos. And again, yeah,

333
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:28,680
we were we were all of our plans
were, you know, shifted by but

334
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,010
in disarray, by everything that
has happened. Yeah. When

335
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,490
Audrow Nash: that happened.
Yeah.

336
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:39,149
Dayo McIntosh: So we were really
excited to again, have this

337
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:44,369
experience of actually selling
with Addie and gauging customer

338
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:47,339
experience, user experience.
And, again, getting that

339
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,609
feedback. I think that's really
important. As we iterate and as

340
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,509
we grow. Right. So

341
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,720
Audrow Nash: what So you
mentioned it a little bit, but

342
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,810
the hope with Addie, is it
start? So basically, people come

343
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,500
for the robot, and then it
engages them in meaningful

344
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,810
conversation about their self
care effectively. Yes, that's

345
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,200
yeah, the draw of the robot and
then maybe build a community

346
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,970
around this. Yeah.

347
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,870
Dayo McIntosh: Well, so at ease,
definitely a novelty, right. We

348
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,280
haven't built into a truck. And
I don't think right now is with

349
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,880
the right love until like, it
makes me super excited. And and

350
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,510
robotics is the future of so who
knows what will happen. But it

351
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,600
is a novel team. And the idea is
that the efficacy of our

352
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,710
products will bring people back
to say that it serves two

353
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,800
purposes. First, it's
experiential retail. So again,

354
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,740
you're having this experience,
people have this fun, it's

355
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,190
you're having conversations,
you're having community, right

356
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:49,200
around this really fun, this
novel, really interactive,

357
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,890
unique experience, right. And
then the other hand is

358
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:57,150
operational efficiency. So we
envision a time where the second

359
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,780
it will be put to use in the
back fulfilling orders and

360
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:05,250
manufacturing. And so that's
that's the goal, the single

361
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,540
robotic arm can turn out based
on our calculations, let's say

362
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,760
about 500 products in a 24 hour
period. And even more than that,

363
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,050
so that definitely kicks into
gear, what we're doing, and

364
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:23,730
we're able to put out huge
volumes, as control all of them.

365
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,300
Audrow Nash: Doing it manually.
How long would that take? You to

366
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:27,450
do?

367
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,130
Dayo McIntosh: Yeah. I mean, 500
Do you have someone like making

368
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,090
that? I would say maybe, like
less than half of that.

369
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,720
Possibly. But then you don't
have people working? 24/7 Right.

370
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,140
Like,

371
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,770
Audrow Nash: definitely. We
manual and repetitive and like

372
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,400
yeah, not

373
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,200
Dayo McIntosh: rather, exactly.
would rather people would rather

374
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,700
the humans use that time to
engage and interface with

375
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,810
customers and have meaningful
conversations versus doing this

376
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,420
manual? Taxing indexing work?

377
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:06,389
Audrow Nash: For sure. Oh, what
a cool thing. Yeah. Let's see.

378
00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:12,149
So how, I guess how did you pick
a Kuka arm? Like those are?

379
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:16,049
Like, I believe pretty expensive
arms? They're like really nice

380
00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:20,669
arms? Yeah. I think like, I
mean, you don't have to give me

381
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:23,429
the exact number but I think
like $40,000 for like one of

382
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:24,539
those arms. Something.

383
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:28,469
Dayo McIntosh: That's That's
exactly right. They are quite

384
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:35,099
expensive. That is a very good
question. I have to this day I I

385
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,679
don't know I just have this
fascination with Kuka

386
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,719
specifically have this fixation
on Kuka. And it again, it's

387
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:47,789
unexplainable. I don't know why.
But I think the few times I've

388
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:51,329
been around robots, they've been
cool. Cuz so that may explain

389
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:55,679
that. But as far as the cost,
you're absolutely right. They're

390
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,039
all super expensive. And for
someone who's like

391
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,209
bootstrapping, And so big
expense all at once. It's a big

392
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:08,519
expense. And so when I set out
working with limited funds, I

393
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:12,449
send an SOS and this is what I
call it an SOS different

394
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:17,189
robotics groups that I was a
part of asking if someone if

395
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:21,329
anyone had any, like, used
robots, you know, that they

396
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:24,959
could sell sell to me for a
certain amount of money. And

397
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:29,189
someone happened to respond. And
at the time, she was the CEO for

398
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:35,159
Cafe X, the coffee robot in the
Bay Area. Cool. And she just

399
00:25:35,189 --> 00:25:38,969
responded and say, Hey, we have
this, this arm in the back. It's

400
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:41,939
been there for years. We don't
even know if it works. But

401
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:45,419
you're more than welcome to have
it. Yeah. And so that's how we

402
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:51,239
got started. So I got that for
like a fraction, like maybe 10%

403
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:56,909
of the cost of what so what
else? Yeah, yeah. So that's,

404
00:25:56,939 --> 00:26:01,139
that's my wild, wild acquisition
story. The very first

405
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,020
Audrow Nash: one. Did you did
something similar for come

406
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,640
through for the second one? Or
how did

407
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,640
Dayo McIntosh: for the second
one, we just got? We're able to

408
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,350
use the insurance money? Payout
from the last Yeah, to

409
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,170
Audrow Nash: whatever. I mean,
that like it works out for I

410
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:16,470
mean,

411
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,810
Dayo McIntosh: it I mean, yeah,
I would rather that didn't

412
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,680
happen. But like, I know, you
know, that was that was great,

413
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,370
right, that we had this option?
And because replace Yeah, we

414
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:30,210
could we could very easily
replace what was so

415
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,489
Audrow Nash: I'm glad it was
insured. Gosh,

416
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:36,990
Dayo McIntosh: I know. Yeah, it
all worked out well.

417
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:42,449
Audrow Nash: And then. So now,
actually, would you would you

418
00:26:42,449 --> 00:26:45,209
tell me a bit about your
background? Because you've

419
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:48,359
mentioned so you're not an
engineer, but you this whole

420
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,519
project? Like? How did you come
to this?

421
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,210
Dayo McIntosh: That is a very
good question. Like I get that

422
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,440
question a lot. Because it just
doesn't make sense. Right? And

423
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,980
Audrow Nash: well, it doesn't
matter. It's I think it makes

424
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,790
sense. But yeah,

425
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,330
Dayo McIntosh: I love robotics.
So for me personally, I've

426
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,830
always been fascinated by
innovation and just technology

427
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:15,210
in general. I think that's just
my personality. There's this, I

428
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,940
have this very curious nature.
And I'm again, fascinated,

429
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,910
that's that's the only way to
put it fascinated by how things

430
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,230
work, and just the innovation
behind it. And so when I started

431
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:31,110
set out to create a business, I
wanted to incorporate that

432
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:36,240
fascination with innovation with
robotics into what I was doing,

433
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,960
again, knowing that this is the
future. So I tell people, I'm

434
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,810
not an engineer, I'm not a
technologist by any stretch of

435
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,860
the imagination. My background
is actually in project

436
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,470
management and program
management. And I've done that

437
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:56,280
for the last. I did that over 10
years across the energy, oil and

438
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,620
gas tech industry and real
estate industry. And so I think

439
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,420
those the acquired skill sets
over you know, 10 years has

440
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:11,220
really helped me in my
bootstrapping efforts with the

441
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,690
limited resources I have to get
it and yet so to where it is

442
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,050
today.

443
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,700
Audrow Nash: How did you so how
did you pick that you wanted to

444
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,460
I mean, that just the all the
decisions along the way are

445
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:33,780
really how did you pick Consu?
So robotics okay, I get it.

446
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,840
You're fascinated by technology.
And so you wanted to do

447
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,290
something with technology didn't
Is that how it started? But then

448
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,630
like, how did you get into
beauty products? Or like self

449
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,590
care products?

450
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,930
Unknown: Yeah. Yeah, kind

451
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,220
Audrow Nash: of marry the two
ideas

452
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,720
Dayo McIntosh: that's yeah, I
was laughing because yeah, go

453
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:54,960
on.

454
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,770
Audrow Nash: And then fit them
to the together and say we can

455
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,670
make a robot through the final
mix further. Yeah. It's

456
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,920
interesting how you how you've
arrived at this

457
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,590
Dayo McIntosh: Yeah, like
hearing you say it and hearing

458
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:12,120
people say it I had made it is
crazy. Like I could never have

459
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,930
you know, orchestrated this on
my own. I think things just came

460
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,740
together and lined up in a way
that made so much sense. And now

461
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:26,280
looking back I'm just I guess,
amazed at what has transpired.

462
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,430
So I started yet so after going
through a really challenging

463
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:38,730
point in my life. I don't know
if you're familiar with, you

464
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,580
know, the stats that the medical
community has put out has put

465
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,320
out about the lack of safe
products in the market. And like

466
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,520
the toxic ingredients and
chemicals that we've seen, okay,

467
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,770
so the beauty industry is
unfortunately, notorious for

468
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:59,640
lacks regulations around the
ingredients and chemicals in a

469
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,380
lot of the products that we use.
And not only that, it hasn't

470
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,980
always been inclusive, it didn't
always cater to everybody,

471
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,920
right? There were certain
demographics that were left out

472
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:16,920
such as myself women of color.
And you learn that the average

473
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,700
woman uses about 12 products on
a daily basis that exposes her

474
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:26,370
to about 168, chemicals,
ingredients, a lot of which have

475
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:30,120
now been linked to everything
from like allergies to cancer,

476
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:33,270
and even reproductive
dysfunction, which hits a bit

477
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:36,090
too close to home for me. And so
that's my story. That's the

478
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:39,960
background of of this, right.
And so going through that really

479
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,040
challenging point in my life, I
decided or determined that I

480
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,710
wanted to take better care of
myself, I wanted to invest in my

481
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,070
well being, I wanted to be
conscious about the products

482
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:54,390
that I was using, just as I was
conscious about the food I was

483
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:59,280
eating, right. So I, I tend to
eat healthy. And so I wanted to

484
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:03,450
also have that reflected in, you
know, the rest of my my well

485
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,770
being, like the products I use
and things like that. So I spend

486
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,980
time doing a lot of research,
but I was really disappointed

487
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,170
with the lack of safe and again,
inclusive products in the

488
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,470
market, things have gotten much
better, because there's more

489
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:20,940
awareness now. But at the time,
it was just sorely lacking. And

490
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,270
so I started mixing and matching
products in my kitchen, I

491
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:28,140
started creating products for
myself. And that process was

492
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:32,970
just very restorative and very
therapeutic. And so I wanted to,

493
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,300
I guess offer that to others who
were on similar paths who are

494
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:41,610
looking for solutions that were
chemical free, non toxic, vegan,

495
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,960
cruelty free. And so that's how
yet to get started. And from

496
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,910
that, the idea of marrying
technology to that because

497
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,900
again, where the world is
evolving, right? And so I wanted

498
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,830
to evolve or create a brand, the
company that will be around and

499
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,400
relevant not just for today, but
for the future. And so that's

500
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,580
where the idea of robotics came
into intervene and marrying that

501
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,090
together.

502
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:11,910
Audrow Nash: So the desire to
start the company because of the

503
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:16,020
lack of options, lack of
inclusive options, and then the

504
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:21,600
lack of safe options that came
first. And then yes, you then

505
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,370
had the idea to put the robot.
How did you fit the robot into

506
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:30,270
the like, how did you go? This
is how I can use a robot in this

507
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:30,960
situation?

508
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:38,190
Dayo McIntosh: Like the aha
moments? Yeah, I don't. Again, I

509
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,550
couldn't even tell you a
pinpoint like, this is exactly

510
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,820
what happened that, that set
that in motion. It's just

511
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,450
something clicked at some point.
And I was like, I'm going to use

512
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,170
the robots to create this really
awesome experience for people

513
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:55,860
and get that conversation
started. And who knows, it may

514
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:00,330
have been I mean, I've been
primed from, you know, maybe

515
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,780
robots as seen throughout my
life, or just different

516
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:09,000
impressions. I can't exactly
pinpoint, you know, the specific

517
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,420
moment and the specific moments,
but it just clicked one day, I

518
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,600
was just like, and this is what
we're doing. And we're going to

519
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,110
incorporate robotics and it's
all going to like mesh. I like

520
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:23,940
the way you said it. I say this
a lot. We married the apothecary

521
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,780
with robotics. And that's what
we're doing at marrying this

522
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:31,109
Audrow Nash: security. Or it's
what's apothecary, I don't know

523
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:31,529
the word.

524
00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:34,649
Dayo McIntosh: And the classic
carry is for Yeah, in the past

525
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:39,149
where you'd go to have I guess
someone that came to a

526
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:44,309
pharmacist back then create
these like potions or

527
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,469
concoctions that you use for
you. Exactly. So I like that

528
00:33:49,469 --> 00:33:53,579
idea of being very authentic,
being very traditional, right?

529
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:57,329
We're not we're not using
product or ingredients that

530
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:00,029
people have never heard don't
know how to pronounce. It's all

531
00:34:00,029 --> 00:34:04,649
natural stuff. Right? And so
just again, going with that age

532
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:09,149
old idea and marry that with
this technology. I think it just

533
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:17,639
checks the box for me of this
beautiful like the old for

534
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,719
representation. Yeah, exactly.
Just marrying the old and the

535
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,969
new. Yeah, it's I think it's
beautiful. So

536
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,450
Audrow Nash: yeah, no, yeah, I
like it too. And one thing I'm

537
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:32,370
struck by is your care about the
experience rather than just like

538
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,150
pumping out products. How did
you decide to focus on the

539
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:41,010
experience more than like, say
just making a bunch of them and

540
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:44,130
like promoting with ads or like
whatever other companies often

541
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:44,430
do.

542
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,090
Dayo McIntosh: It goes back to
So yeah, tell means exceptional.

543
00:34:52,590 --> 00:35:00,120
And it's from yerba. It is
Nigerian so Yoruba is a true I

544
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,830
live in Nigeria. And yet so
comes from the Yerba tribe. So

545
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:11,070
yes, it means exceptional
because we acknowledge that

546
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,260
there's no one size fits all,
when it comes to beauty and

547
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,710
wellness, like we're all
different. What might work for

548
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:20,040
you might not necessarily work
for me and vice versa, right.

549
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,920
And so, the idea behind this was
that people have this platform

550
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:31,140
to create products tailored to
their unique goals and needs and

551
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:35,250
wants. And that was the idea,
the driving force behind like,

552
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,980
the name, the brand, everything
we're doing, right, the

553
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,490
individual individualization and
personalization of creating

554
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:47,370
something for you, that will
force you or encourage you, or

555
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,980
empower you to invest in your
well being and take better care

556
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,100
of yourself. Because when you do
that, when you feel good, when

557
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,090
you look good, it all translates
to every aspect of your life and

558
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,230
your your quality of life is so
much better. And so that is that

559
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,590
is what we're about, right? We
want people to have a better

560
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:08,340
quality of life, so that they
can really enjoy the one life

561
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,120
they have to live.

562
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,470
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Now, I
don't know very much about like,

563
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,950
I don't know, like, I mean, I
use lotion, but that's about the

564
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:22,950
extent. Okay. Can you tell me
like, I don't really know, the

565
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,280
so if I didn't use lotion? Or if
I, and then all the what are

566
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,620
some of the other products? And
what's kind of the importance of

567
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:33,030
all of these? Like, you say you
feel really good. And that's if

568
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,880
you feel really good, you're
more confident or things like

569
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,360
Yes, but how does it kind of
fit? And how can it specifically

570
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,680
help a person to invest in their
own? What do you call it?

571
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,020
Dayo McIntosh: Well, being well
being? Yes. So we don't do like

572
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,940
makeup, right? We're more about
the personal care. So it's,

573
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,350
again, if you think about all
those chemicals and ingredients

574
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,950
that are toxic and affect your
health. That's what we mean

575
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:06,180
about feel good, right? It's not
an artificial, we're, we're

576
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:11,730
really concerned about actually
feeling good. You know, like,

577
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,700
you're healthy, you're, well,
when you're healthy, you're

578
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,660
happy, right? Imagine if you
have allergies, or you have

579
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,830
cancer as a result of what
you're using. It affects your

580
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:27,450
outlook, right and your, your
carriage in general, just

581
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,900
because you're you're miserable,
you're in pain or your whatever

582
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,690
it may be. So imagine being
well, you're well, you're

583
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,910
healthy, you feel good, you're
able to enjoy

584
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,860
Audrow Nash: things in life that
you want to do that you

585
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:43,080
Dayo McIntosh: want to do. Yeah,
and I think it seems, or right.

586
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,650
And it might seem so yes,
exactly. And it might seem so

587
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:50,220
trivial, but like things like
that really matter. And again,

588
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,160
it's it translates to every
aspect of your life. If you're

589
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:59,850
healthy. And well, you're,
you're happy, you know, because

590
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:03,060
you're not afflicted by, you
know, all these other things

591
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:09,540
that might, you know, casts cast
a shadow or impact you

592
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,920
negatively, you know,

593
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,980
Audrow Nash: yeah, you're never
I don't know, it's like, if

594
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,990
you're healthy, you don't think
about it. But if you're

595
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,280
unhealthy about it.

596
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,700
Dayo McIntosh: Oh, you think
about it. Yeah. And your

597
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,840
constant. It's a constant
reminder. Yeah.

598
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:26,759
Audrow Nash: And so you can't do
other things, because you're

599
00:38:26,759 --> 00:38:30,869
preoccupied with just like
health and existence and this

600
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:34,259
kind of Exactly, exactly. You're
saying allergies, you said

601
00:38:34,259 --> 00:38:39,119
reproductive issues. cancer,
cancer. Yeah. And these are

602
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:43,559
these are coming. Like they're
positively linked to products

603
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,539
that are often used in the
beauty industry.

604
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,720
Dayo McIntosh: There are links
to chemicals and ingredients

605
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,910
that we see in everyday products
that that we use, and that's

606
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:58,950
alarming, right? For sure. It's
alarming. And again, these are,

607
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,520
it's it's new research, right?
The the medical community is now

608
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,700
linking them to these things,
but it's because of the

609
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:10,680
awareness. So there's a
organization called the EW G and

610
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,800
there's several other ones
coming out, that are focused on

611
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,570
bringing awareness to things
like this so that we can change

612
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,080
or the government can change
those lacks regulations, like we

613
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,490
need to do better, because
people are ill, they're they're

614
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:30,750
unwell because of I mean,
there's a direct correlation

615
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:34,470
many times. So if we're able to,
like make those adjustments and

616
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:38,910
make those changes, just imagine
how happier how, like, better

617
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,380
off people would be in general.

618
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:42,449
Audrow Nash: Yeah, they get on
with their lives rather than

619
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:46,259
worrying about things or what
exactly yeah, and have lived the

620
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:49,859
life they want to live rather
than what they're Yeah, they're

621
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:53,279
having health difficulties or
unable to have kids. Yeah,

622
00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:54,089
something like that.

623
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,270
Dayo McIntosh: Exactly. And so
we're going to, you know, get

624
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:01,050
that conversation started with
ADE. Big engage people draw

625
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:05,430
them in again with this, you
know, fascination, this novelty.

626
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:11,520
But really we're after the, the
the core of the matter, like the

627
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:16,200
meat of it is that we want
people to be intentional about

628
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:20,580
how they take care of themselves
what they use, so that they have

629
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,420
a better life.

630
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,470
Audrow Nash: Oh, yeah, I really
like that. Yeah. So what's the

631
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,220
what's the range of products
that you're mostly offering?

632
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:34,260
Dayo McIntosh: Yeah. So we
started off with Hair Skin and

633
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:38,730
aromatherapy oils. So right now
we just offer oils and butters.

634
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,630
So you mentioned you use lotion.
And butter is similar to lotion,

635
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:46,380
but it doesn't have water. Like,
the consistency of lotion is

636
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,100
like very light. Yeah, butter is
very thick. So think of mushy

637
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:54,450
butter. Yeah, exactly. Oh, do
you Okay, yeah, exactly. So we

638
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:58,980
offer things like that. Again, I
talked about the hair for your

639
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,610
skin. And then the diffuser
oils, there are my therapy oils

640
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:07,800
or the fuser oils. So essential
oil blends, that you would add

641
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:15,420
to your diffuser. And it just,
it's it, it changes the mood,

642
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:20,790
right, it has an impact on your
mood. And those are, again, when

643
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:24,240
we say we say well being,
because that encapsulates

644
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:28,560
personal care, beauty and
wellness in general.

645
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,710
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. And just
for the essential oils and

646
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,890
things that so that the world
smells like the oils, right? So

647
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,380
like you put it in something and
it like bubbles it or something,

648
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,560
and it makes it so that
everything smells really nice.

649
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,160
And you're saying that's tied to
mood and things like this. I

650
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,630
admit I'm really
unsophisticated.

651
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:50,850
Dayo McIntosh: That's fine. A
lot of people don't know about

652
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:56,310
this. But it's so essential oils
have because they are very

653
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:00,390
natural. They're very potent, do
derived from plants from roots,

654
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:04,980
whatever, they're potent, and
they're effective, right?

655
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,930
They've been known, we can make
any claims because those haven't

656
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,150
been cleared yet. But they've
been known to help with, like

657
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:18,240
stress to, to help with
depression many times, like

658
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,720
there's a long list of what are
the benefits of essential oils?

659
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:25,050
Again, we can't make any direct
claims, because there's still a

660
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:30,930
lot of like research and that
needs to go into that. To make

661
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:36,960
them you know, things that are
allowable of sorts. Yeah. So

662
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:40,860
they've been known to, to help
with certain things with health,

663
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:44,610
right, and the well being and
they've been used for years for,

664
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:47,790
you know, for a long time only
say since the beginning of the

665
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:52,260
world, but very long, so So
yeah, so we're just tapping into

666
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,040
the benefits of those things.
And again, when you defuse these

667
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,270
things, they they help with
those ailments. Like for

668
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:04,290
example, we have a blend we call
sleep. It has camo mill, it has

669
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,950
cedar wood, and it has French
lavender. And that is to help

670
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:13,770
you have like a retinol. Yeah,
it does. It smells amazing. It

671
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:18,720
helps you have like restful,
peaceful sleep, or sleep. And so

672
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,280
again, it all ties back to
improving the quality of life.

673
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:29,100
Right? If you get good rest your
you function better during the

674
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:29,820
day, so yeah,

675
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:33,990
Audrow Nash: yeah, I mean, I,
like even I am not speaking

676
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:36,870
about the efficiency of any of
these towards like actually

677
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,010
carrying anything, or fixing or
reducing. But even from like a

678
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:44,970
habit perspective, which I'm big
into habits, like if you play

679
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:48,240
the same music at the same time,
every day can make it easier to

680
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,560
get into a specific state of
like consciousness or something.

681
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,620
And so if you were to do the
same essential oil, and you

682
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,070
smell it, and it's like, Okay,
now it's sleepy time, this kind

683
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,070
of thing that could be very
valuable. Yeah, exactly.

684
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,850
Ingredients. So you're not like
poisoning yourself while you're

685
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:06,630
trying to get good.

686
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:10,980
Dayo McIntosh: Exactly. Right.
Yeah, exactly. So like we're

687
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,880
very conscious about, again,
like, the stuff that we're

688
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,550
giving people because it
matters, right? We source

689
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:21,210
everything from like one
supplier that works to like

690
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:25,890
local farmers that are paid well
above, you know, what others are

691
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:29,640
getting because again, all of it
matters like it all. It all ties

692
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,380
together. We're very social
conscious brand. And that ties

693
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,590
again into our mission to help
people live their best lives.

694
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:39,060
Sam,

695
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:44,010
Audrow Nash: so you, you say
where, who else is in our How is

696
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:48,360
your team and is it how many
people are helping you guys out

697
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:48,810
yet? So

698
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:55,740
Dayo McIntosh: I am a solo
founder. And but I have built a

699
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,970
village and I've had like
incredible partners along the

700
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,820
way that have helped me get to
where I am. It's it hasn't been

701
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,410
easy because again, it's so much
easier when you have a team. And

702
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:15,000
you're you have a co founder and
you guys are able to share the

703
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,530
burdens of building a business
but specialize to some level to

704
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:27,450
exactly. But yeah, it's been me
from the concepts of design, the

705
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:33,750
operations, all of it. And I've
just been really resourceful

706
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:39,330
about finding the right people
along different paths of the

707
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:42,840
journey to come on board to get
me to the next level.

708
00:45:43,229 --> 00:45:46,529
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Do you. So
how do you work with software

709
00:45:46,529 --> 00:45:49,829
engineers and things like the
people who programmed the arm

710
00:45:49,829 --> 00:45:53,879
about the specific positions?
And what to do?

711
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,580
Dayo McIntosh: How do I work
with them?

712
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,800
Audrow Nash: Like, do you hire
like a do contract?

713
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,100
Dayo McIntosh: Or? You do? Yes,
yeah. So they've been

714
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,420
contractors. I've had a couple
of books, one of them has really

715
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,890
been instrumental in getting it
to where it is. And I tell the

716
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:16,320
story, because it's part of our
startup story, right? i He

717
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:22,140
happens to work at Tesla. And
when I set out to, when I

718
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,530
acquired the arm from Cafe X, I
didn't know what to do, right? I

719
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:29,070
had, again, limited funds,
you're like I have. Now I have

720
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:32,580
this now what? What do I do with
it? I didn't know what to do

721
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:36,600
with it, and hired some people
who had no idea what to do with

722
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:41,070
it. Because Kuka tends to be
very proprietary. And it's

723
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:45,450
pretty, as far as I understand.
Yeah, with a lot of the stuff

724
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:49,170
that he do, and not a lot of
people really know how to use

725
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:52,590
the Kuka. But I live in New
York, which is right next to

726
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:56,190
Fremont. And I remember that
Tesla, just down the street from

727
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:01,020
me and happens to be one of the
biggest customers of poucos. And

728
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,740
so I just started super clever.
Okay, yeah, I just started

729
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:10,440
spamming is what I call it
spamming Tesla employees who had

730
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:16,680
like, robotics or anything like
that, on their LinkedIn profile.

731
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:22,470
And that's how I met my engineer
that again, that has been really

732
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:27,090
instrumental in in the build out
for adding so yeah,

733
00:47:27,479 --> 00:47:29,939
Audrow Nash: gotcha. That's
really cool. That's so funny to

734
00:47:29,939 --> 00:47:32,849
spam. Yeah, the talent.

735
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,920
Dayo McIntosh: I am the queen of
spamming.

736
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,540
Audrow Nash: I've heard this a
lot from startups, where it's

737
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:44,670
like, you have a task, and you
need someone with a specific

738
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,670
skill set. But you probably
can't hire them fully. Because

739
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,280
you're bootstrapping. Yeah,
yeah. So you can contract them a

740
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,400
little bit. But the clever thing
that I've seen a few companies

741
00:47:53,400 --> 00:48:00,330
do is hire someone on like a
contract basis to do a specific

742
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:05,370
task. And you look to the top
companies like Tesla, because

743
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,720
the they're basically a talent
filter in some ways. And also,

744
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,960
like, especially you being very
clever, and going, Oh, Tesla

745
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,190
uses a lot of Kuka arms, I can
find someone there. Yeah. So

746
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:17,910
that seems like,

747
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,880
Dayo McIntosh: like starting
starting a business forces you

748
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,150
to think outside the box. I
mean, for sure. Many times your

749
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,990
back is against the wall, and
you either sink or swim. And so

750
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:34,500
it's in those moments that I
would say your your all your

751
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:38,730
creativity. Yes. Let's use that
word creativity really.

752
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:48,720
Desperation masked as
creativity. Yes. Yes. Correct.

753
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:53,520
Yeah, that's when it really
comes to light. And so yeah,

754
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:57,000
that's, that's how we got to
where we are. But speaking about

755
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:02,190
hiring people for specific
tasks. Outside of the engineer

756
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:06,240
that we used, have gone to have
used the Upwork. I don't know if

757
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:12,720
you're familiar with. They seem
cool. Yeah. Some a lot to to get

758
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,830
people on board for what I need.
For example, as we're looking to

759
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:23,430
fully automate adding a portion
of that is something we call a

760
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:28,920
PLC, programmable logic control
controller. Yeah. And then

761
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,780
having an HMI like the human
machine interface for the tablet

762
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,690
I talked about. So like people
are, you're tapping on the

763
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,840
tablet, you're tapping on the
screen, and that keeps adding to

764
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:46,320
Garin. So all of that is powered
by this PLC. And that has been

765
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,020
the most challenging part of
trying to automate versus

766
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:53,970
finding someone. Yeah, who can
who can develop that or build,

767
00:49:54,210 --> 00:50:00,000
you know that on top of what we
have, and so I've gone to Upwork

768
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,700
work several times to try to
find the right talent.

769
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,700
Audrow Nash: Has that been
successful for you generally, to

770
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,770
find someone who's good with DLC
stuff?

771
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:13,890
Dayo McIntosh: Um, generally, I
mean, we're still, you know,

772
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,780
working that out, but I think
Upwork Upwork is a good is a

773
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:22,470
good resource for for startups
or founders who are looking for

774
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:25,470
contractors. Yeah. Yeah.

775
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:30,030
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Yeah, the
PLC stuff, as I don't know too

776
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:35,490
much about it. But in my, my
impression of it is it's like,

777
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,080
older factory robots. Or maybe,
maybe not, maybe not even older.

778
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,260
But like factory robots, they
would have programmable logic

779
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,570
controllers. And that would be
how you control the robot. And

780
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:49,320
it was like, this was like, from
the 60s or something like this,

781
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,710
that it was used? Oh, really?
Okay. And maybe maybe way off?

782
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:57,000
Maybe 80s? Maybe you I don't
know. But it's amazing to me

783
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,330
that those skills are still
very, like, there's still if you

784
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:02,820
if you are a PLC program, I
think you can make a good

785
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,980
salary. But it's, to me, it
sounds like painful work

786
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,600
Dayo McIntosh: is just really
challenging. And then you factor

787
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,420
in the Kuka part, which a lot of
people don't have experience

788
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,780
with. But yeah, PLCs is what
it's sort of like the brains,

789
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:22,560
right? Especially if you have
different different components

790
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:26,160
outside of the robot. So we have
a payment system, we have the

791
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,680
HMI, we have the robot. So the
PLC serves as, again, the brains

792
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,240
the the project manager, in a
sense like that, that knows when

793
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,610
to call each component into
action.

794
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:41,400
Audrow Nash: For sure, like the
high level organizer of

795
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:41,850
everything,

796
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:45,210
Dayo McIntosh: yes, yes,
exactly. Yeah.

797
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:51,300
Audrow Nash: How do you? I
guess, what's next for you guys?

798
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,880
Like we're Where do you think
that's always headed.

799
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:58,290
Dayo McIntosh: So we definitely
want to get back out there, that

800
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:03,720
is a dream that was deferred.
And so we want to pick up right

801
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,590
where we started, which is
hitting the road with adding

802
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:11,790
demoing, but now actually
selling now that we have

803
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:19,230
products and, you know, products
that people can buy. So that

804
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:23,340
that is in the works. Right now,
we partnered with this company

805
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:29,430
full speed automation to work on
the automation part of of what

806
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,190
we're doing. We say they've been
a part of

807
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:36,210
Audrow Nash: it, like from the
web to distributing or what what

808
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:36,570
part

809
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:40,230
Dayo McIntosh: No, just just the
ADDIE part the operation of the

810
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:46,260
process, from when a person
orders to what ADE does next.

811
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:50,430
And then the final piece of
that. So they've been a really

812
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:54,150
great partner so far, the
ability in the first no code,

813
00:52:55,650 --> 00:53:02,160
sort of automated platform, for
manufacturing for robotics in

814
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:08,820
general. And so they, they saw a
potential opportunity to, to

815
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:13,710
utilize their program for a
robot and see what it does. And

816
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:18,870
so we're able to work with them
to see what comes of that. And I

817
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:22,980
think that will be done in May,
and will finally be able to take

818
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:27,900
it out. And again, yeah, hit the
ground running and see what

819
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:28,920
happens from there.

820
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:35,220
Audrow Nash: And then growing,
so you'll be selling your

821
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:40,980
product. And then I guess you'll
figure out how to reinvest it at

822
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:45,330
the time. Whether it's making
more of the operation autonomous

823
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:50,670
or I guess, yeah. I don't know.
I love the idea of a robot like

824
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:53,460
food truck doing a service. I
think that's the coolest thing.

825
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,490
Dayo McIntosh: Yeah, I mean,
there's so many places we can

826
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:00,690
take this. I mean, one of the
things again, because this is

827
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:05,100
experiential, like we see an
avenue where I talked about

828
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,430
having it at festivals, or like
even private and corporate

829
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:12,690
events. So something akin to
like a photo booth that you'd

830
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:16,440
see at a company party, but
instead are like a wedding and

831
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:21,930
you have custom, you know,
diffuser oils, essential oils

832
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:25,020
for your guests, and they get to
like play with a robot to create

833
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:29,670
that. So there's that avenue.
And then we're currently in the

834
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:33,270
process of trying to patent our
application. And so being able

835
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:38,970
to like monetize that, I think
is is the next next step. Like

836
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:42,180
if we're able to do that I think
that changes the game right? It

837
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,200
changes everything.

838
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:47,010
Audrow Nash: So you mean get a
pat and then maybe you'll

839
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:48,870
license it out or something so
others

840
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:53,550
Dayo McIntosh: exactly there's
that yeah, or franchising. Do

841
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:57,990
vending so, so that is again
another path that we can take

842
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:03,480
but for the immediate Future
were focused on, you know, the

843
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,170
road, just getting back to the
road with our one truck and then

844
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:11,340
leasing it out the truck out for
like events and things like

845
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:15,750
that. So that is the immediate
future. And yeah, we're excited

846
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,040
to see what happens with that.

847
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:20,490
Audrow Nash: Do you think your
first show will be in May? Or

848
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:21,060
your first I

849
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:24,600
Dayo McIntosh: mean, at the end
of May? Yes. And we're actually

850
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:31,740
moving we're relocating to Reno.
So we, Reno, Nevada, Reno,

851
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:40,080
Nevada. Gotcha. The tech scene
is really up and coming there. I

852
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:44,850
noticed. It's also well, it's
close to the California it's

853
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:48,090
close to the Bay Area, which I
love. So I feel like that's,

854
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:51,480
that's still an option for me,
right, I can very easily come

855
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:58,320
back as needed. And then
finally, it's just a great, I

856
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,900
think it's going to be a great
exposure, because you have

857
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:05,760
people from all over coming to
Tahoe, or like that area for

858
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,260
vacation for whatever it may be.
And so you have this element of

859
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:14,460
like a big fish in a small pond
type deal. We were able to get

860
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:20,100
Yeah, so able to build brand.
Brand Awareness quick, quicker

861
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:24,750
than we would here and just meet
the right people and meet the

862
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:28,800
right investors, all in that
area. So that's what I'm

863
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:31,440
gambling on. And we'll see what
happens.

864
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:34,650
Audrow Nash: Oh, yeah, I like
it. I like that.

865
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,140
Dayo McIntosh: Big fan. Yeah. I
mean, I mean, we'll see what

866
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:43,410
happens. Right. And I think your
worst case scenario, we can

867
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:46,890
always come back. But I think I
think that's that's going to be

868
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:53,070
a great dreaming, ground for for
us to like really gloat, grow

869
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:54,720
and flourish? For sure.

870
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:59,040
Audrow Nash: Do you want to our
once the ground has been hit,

871
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,910
and you're off? What do you
imagine will be the first people

872
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:07,410
you'll hire? That that's easy to
be co founder? Oh, it's easy.

873
00:57:07,919 --> 00:57:11,249
Dayo McIntosh: That is easy.
Straight up, I need a marketing

874
00:57:11,309 --> 00:57:16,109
expert, that my first hire is
going to be someone highly

875
00:57:16,109 --> 00:57:21,209
skilled in marketing in the
beauty industry. I am I am great

876
00:57:21,209 --> 00:57:25,259
at executing I'm great at
operations. I'm great ads, you

877
00:57:25,259 --> 00:57:31,499
know, creating. I mean, I think
everything I've done so far, has

878
00:57:31,499 --> 00:57:36,359
been has been great, right? And
the ability to do that. But one

879
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:39,239
area that I struggle with is
marketing, especially in the

880
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:43,559
beauty industry, which is key
like that is crucial for a

881
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:47,579
beauty brand. And so finding
someone who has that background,

882
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:53,069
that experience expertise, all
of that is is the critical hire.

883
00:57:54,029 --> 00:57:59,699
I need I need that person. And
quickly. So yeah, that is that

884
00:57:59,699 --> 00:58:02,369
is the first first hire for
sure.

885
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:08,970
Audrow Nash: Hell yeah. And then
investment are you? Have you

886
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:13,200
taken any money yet? Are you? A
well? Are you looking for angel

887
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,830
investors? Are you like, where
are you at in terms of funding?

888
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:25,290
Dayo McIntosh: Yeah. So I, I
went, this is just an idea. I

889
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:29,040
was part of a founder Institute
accelerator. And so there you're

890
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:33,600
kind of like, coached on like,
like, pitching, trying to raise

891
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,170
money. But it was just an idea
and such a wild idea that it

892
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:43,320
just wasn't. I mean, I wasn't
having like serious

893
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:48,030
conversations, right. And so I
just decided that I needed to

894
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:52,080
put my head down, build, have
traction, and then go back to

895
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,710
the table for these people to
take me seriously. And so that's

896
00:58:55,710 --> 00:59:00,540
what I set my mind on doing. I
got a business loan, an SBA

897
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:05,220
loan, cashed out my 401 K. And
that's what has gotten me this

898
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:09,120
far. I am now at the point where
I do need to get some sort of

899
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:14,760
investment. I have, you know,
working prototypes, some

900
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:20,070
traction, you know, and I feel
like I can now go back to that

901
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:24,720
table to have those, those
conversations. And so I'm just

902
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,860
starting down that path. Again,
I think Angel invests investors

903
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:32,340
are who I need at this point,
before bringing in any

904
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:37,920
institutional like larger, like
venture venture capital

905
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,610
investors, probably so yeah, I
just I need someone that

906
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:44,910
believes in the vision and the
dream and sometimes when I sit

907
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:52,020
in front of investors, they
don't quite get it. And so I

908
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:55,050
know that they're not the right
partners, right? I need someone

909
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:58,560
that that is like I bind I see
where you're going with this and

910
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,920
I'm excited because I See the
potential. That's who I'm

911
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,720
looking for. And that's what I
need. So

912
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:07,110
Audrow Nash: you're starting a
conversation, and then you'll

913
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:11,130
have quality products behind it,
is how I kind of see it. And the

914
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:13,920
robot is a great way to start
that conversation, get people

915
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:18,510
excited. Like that. I mean, I,
I'm trying to imagine like other

916
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:23,400
beauty products, were there,
like we would have, we would be

917
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,070
at a wedding or something like
some special event. And it's

918
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:29,760
like, it would just be like, a
shelf with their things. Whereas

919
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,250
you like people will come over
and see, it'll be like a big

920
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:36,180
hit. Yeah, because everyone is
an experienced robot work? Yeah.

921
01:00:36,449 --> 01:00:40,049
Dayo McIntosh: Yeah, you have it
a sweet 16 party or a bar

922
01:00:40,049 --> 01:00:43,559
mitzvah? Or whatever. Like,
it's, it's an experience. It's

923
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:48,899
like, I mean, just like when the
photo booths came out, right?

924
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:51,719
Like people are constantly
looking for entertainment or

925
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:55,139
experiences at their events. And
so this is just going to be one

926
01:00:55,139 --> 01:00:56,549
other option for them.

927
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,550
Audrow Nash: Yeah. And then it
starts off, it kicks off that

928
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:05,250
wellness conversation, too. And
also the conversation about a

929
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:09,180
lot of the other companies or
maybe not a lot, I don't know,

930
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:13,440
many other products having
toxins and unhealthy things.

931
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,600
Yeah. So then making people more
conscious,

932
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:22,050
Dayo McIntosh: more aware, yeah,
I feel like healthy eating. I

933
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:24,960
mean, similar to the path that
that took, right, it just became

934
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:33,180
a thing. And like maybe the last
six, seven years, maybe maybe

935
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,390
more in the Bay Area in
California, but around the

936
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:41,400
country, if you really got that
urgency, or that we started to

937
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,970
see change in the last five or
six years around healthy, like

938
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:47,820
healthy eating organic, things
like that. So I think this is

939
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:52,920
going to take that same path of
progression. You starting the

940
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,830
conversation, and then people
become fully aware, and they

941
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:58,830
start making those necessary
changes. Lifestyle changes.

942
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:02,700
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Let's see
what are just kind of a bit of a

943
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,950
side tangent. But what are some
things people should look out

944
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:10,320
for in products to make sure
they're not putting toxic

945
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,310
products on them?

946
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:16,380
Dayo McIntosh: You've heard of
like, parrot beings? Well, you

947
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:25,110
may not have heard of it, but
like parabens. fragrances. You

948
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:30,630
want to avoid things like that.
And there's there's a long list,

949
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:33,390
which I know there's some debate
about that, because you can't

950
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:37,260
cut out all like chemicals.
Right? Yeah, I mean, even like,

951
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:40,110
you need some of them to numb
and things like this. So

952
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:44,640
exactly. But it's just being
mindful about what you're using.

953
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:50,160
So the US compared to I think,
the UK, Europe, has they have

954
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:55,410
better, better regulations?
They've limited the ingredients

955
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:58,140
and the chemicals that can be
used. And yeah, you know,

956
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:01,560
they're they're doing well, I
mean, they still have those

957
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,530
companies and those companies
have adjusted right to meet

958
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:08,310
those, those charges. So I think
we can do the same thing over

959
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:08,970
here as well.

960
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:14,760
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. And, like
going back to the angel investor

961
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:19,860
talk, and you don't have to
answer if either it's too new or

962
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:22,770
whatever. But what would be like
a meaningful amount of money

963
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:27,090
that you'd be looking for
investment, like how much would

964
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:30,360
kind of be a nice step for you,
to help you keep the vision

965
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:30,750
going.

966
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:35,640
Dayo McIntosh: I'm looking to
raise 500,000 At this point, and

967
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:39,720
I've kind of projected that that
will be like a 1212 month runway

968
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:45,000
to get us to profitability is
what I'm looking at in my mind.

969
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,370
And that's to hire the right
people to get the inventory we

970
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:55,290
need for you know, some of the
proceeds that have come our way

971
01:03:55,290 --> 01:04:00,540
such as like b2b opportunities,
and then fully automating Addie,

972
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:03,240
and having that in house
manufacturing that I that I

973
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:07,380
spoke about. So that's, that's
what I'm looking at raising

974
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:10,680
right now. And then we'll adjust
as we move forward.

975
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:15,240
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. And what
what lessons have you learned

976
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:19,020
from this whole process? Like,
what were some of the biggest

977
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:22,590
takeaways, if you had to do this
all again, other than lock up

978
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:23,130
the truck?

979
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:32,310
Dayo McIntosh: I'd say start,
first of all, start small and

980
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:38,220
start with just start somewhere.
I find sometimes I'm very much

981
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:43,080
of a perfectionist and it can be
crippling right and it took me a

982
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,020
while to actually get out the
gate because I wanted things to

983
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:48,840
be perfect. So it had to be a
certain way had to look a

984
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:52,260
certain way and sometimes you
need to be in the market and and

985
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:55,680
generate feedback from people so
that you can build a better

986
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:01,230
product right? That that would
be my advice to myself, even if

987
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:04,110
I could start over, it's just
start go with the strength you

988
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:07,860
have start where you are. And
then you can build on that as

989
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:10,830
you go along. And then when I
got started with a premade

990
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:12,900
products, there were just so
many things that I went to

991
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:16,740
market with so many options,
because I wanted everyone to

992
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:21,510
have an option like for
themselves, right. And it's very

993
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:24,630
hard to like market that and to
build on that when you get

994
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:29,370
started. So I always say start
small, get a small, niche

995
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:32,340
following people that are crazy,
absolutely crazy about what

996
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:36,450
you're building, like fanatical,
even about what you're building

997
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:40,320
because that excitement that
that passion, like spreads and

998
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,920
grows. Right. And and then
you're able to draw more people

999
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,390
in. Based on their their, their
excitement. Yeah.

1000
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:52,170
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Also, I mean,
I've heard of this whole idea of

1001
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:56,460
like, I don't know, there's
like, if you have 10,000 fans,

1002
01:05:56,490 --> 01:06:01,380
or if you have 100 fans or
something, like if you have that

1003
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:05,190
group. So if you have the 10,000
fans, and they are, let's say

1004
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:09,030
1000, and they give you $1 Each
or something like that, sorry,

1005
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:11,640
if you have 100 fans, and they
give you $10 Each, they're kind

1006
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:15,360
of the same thing. Yeah. So if
you if you have like that core

1007
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,660
group that really likes what
you're doing. Yeah. And have a

1008
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:23,040
small audience that's just like
so behind you. And they really

1009
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,660
have this kind of thing.

1010
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,080
Dayo McIntosh: Yeah. And again,
that excitement that passion is

1011
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:35,220
contagious. They talk about it.
People get curious. Exactly. You

1012
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:38,190
have the people that are curious
now because they've heard so

1013
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:43,170
much about this. Yeah, it's just
it's just I think the way to go.

1014
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,520
And it's a good lesson lesson
for me going forward.

1015
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,120
Audrow Nash: Yes. Do you have
any, any ideas on how to like

1016
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,810
foster that? Have you as
anything you've done work to yet

1017
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:59,790
or? I don't know. I'm wondering,
how's it? How's that going? It

1018
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:00,720
seems so far.

1019
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:02,700
Dayo McIntosh: It seems well, go
ahead seems like

1020
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,040
Audrow Nash: a challenging
thing, because in theory, it

1021
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:09,990
makes a lot of sense. I'm just,
I don't know, the practical way

1022
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:12,540
of getting there seems a little
murky to me.

1023
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:20,850
Dayo McIntosh: Yeah. I used to
think social media was like, so

1024
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:26,610
easy. Like marketing in general.
You put up a picture and like,

1025
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:30,750
you know, people come or
whatever it may be, but I'm

1026
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:36,120
finding it. It's Rocket Science.
Like there's a, there's a method

1027
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:40,680
to the madness, there's, you
know, it's, I mean, you have to

1028
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,990
know what you're doing. And
again, back to the beauty

1029
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:49,980
industry. People are hesitant to
try the unknown, right? Because

1030
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:52,530
you're talking about their
health, which is kind of ironic,

1031
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:56,040
because we're trying to, like
help them do better. What are

1032
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:59,490
you talking about your health
and like overall, like

1033
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,130
presentation and Outlook, right?
So people are very cautious

1034
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:06,120
about what they use. And so
they're very hesitant to try

1035
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:09,780
something new or something that
hasn't been validated by a

1036
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:13,530
celebrity or an influencer, or
someone like that, that they

1037
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:16,140
will trust. And so that's one of
the challenges that we're

1038
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:20,220
running into is, is finding that
partnership or finding someone

1039
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:25,290
who can sort of give that that
validation or that blessing to

1040
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:29,010
take us to the next level. So in
the meantime, we're just, you

1041
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:33,060
know, trying different things to
see what works. And then just

1042
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:37,830
trying to have conversations and
connect with people, too. Yeah.

1043
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:38,670
To grow from there.

1044
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:41,670
Audrow Nash: Oh, yeah. Can you
imagine any other ways that

1045
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:44,850
robots will be used in your
whole process? Or I mean, so you

1046
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:47,730
have the arm as a mixologist and
you have an arm as kind of a

1047
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:53,010
front show? mixologist? Can you
imagine any other ways robots

1048
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,120
can use or

1049
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:58,050
Dayo McIntosh: what do you mean
by French show? Like, wanting to

1050
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,900
manufacture? Okay, so yeah, so
we haven't won in a

1051
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,400
Audrow Nash: Trump manufacturing
one?

1052
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:08,520
Dayo McIntosh: Yes, exactly.
Yes. So the patent we we filed

1053
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:15,210
doesn't limit us to just like
robotic arm, if that makes

1054
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:19,920
sense. So we have like, it can
it can look like whatever form

1055
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,520
that is, you know, provided it's
approved, right? can look like a

1056
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,390
different form. And so, in the
future, like we're going to

1057
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:32,160
explore what else we can do with
that. Again, as you know,

1058
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:37,170
technology evolves as people
become more familiar and

1059
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:41,520
comfortable with robots in
general. We can we can really

1060
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,230
explore that then down the road.

1061
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:46,740
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Well, I
look forward to seeing that.

1062
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:52,080
Dayo McIntosh: Yeah, me too. I,
again, I'm so excited about what

1063
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,770
I'm building here, right because
I married this and passionate

1064
01:09:55,770 --> 01:10:00,930
about, you know, having making a
call positive impact on the

1065
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:05,280
world. And for me, that looks
like helping people like live a

1066
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:10,080
better life. Because that's
connected to my personal story.

1067
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:15,000
And then like just dealing with
innovation robots in general,

1068
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,260
like how cool so I'm super
excited to be, you know,

1069
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:22,710
building this brand where I get
to marry those two things and,

1070
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:29,220
and just see this crazy dream
come to life. It just makes me

1071
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:33,450
really happy and excited. So I'm
just, I'm very excited to see

1072
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:36,360
what comes of this. I don't know
where it's gonna go. I don't

1073
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,870
know what it's gonna look like,
you know, five years, 10 years

1074
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:42,480
down the road, but I am excited
about the journey.

1075
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,870
Audrow Nash: Oh, yeah. I love
that. Yeah. Yeah. See? So

1076
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:50,640
wrapping up. Is there any
contact info, website info,

1077
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,970
anything you'd like to pass on
to our listeners and watchers?

1078
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:55,260
Yeah,

1079
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:00,000
Dayo McIntosh: you can find us
online on yeto.com. And that's

1080
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:06,180
why@eou.com. On there, we have a
contact form, you can reach out

1081
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:10,440
to us on there. You could also
send us an email at Hello at

1082
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:17,550
Yateou, which is why@eou.com. And,
yeah, we respond really quickly.

1083
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:25,440
And yeah. If anyone is looking
for technical specs on the robot

1084
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:32,130
we have it's a Kuka agilus spot.
The smaller one is a QR six or

1085
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:37,380
700. And the larger one is a QR
six are 900. So that one is

1086
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:40,890
slightly bigger than the one we
had previously. And it has a

1087
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:41,970
longer reach.

1088
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:45,660
Audrow Nash: Awesome. Thank you.
Yeah.
