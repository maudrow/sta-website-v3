00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,840
Audrow Nash: Hi, everyone.
Welcome to the Sense Think Act

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,290
Podcast. I'm Audrow Nash. And in
this episode, I'm going to be

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,720
introducing the sensing gap
podcast.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,020
So this podcast will feature
longer interviews on various

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,110
topics in robotics. So I'll
speak with people that are

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,890
starting robotics companies,
larger robotics companies,

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,860
researchers, both in academia
and in industry, people that are

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,860
involved with robotics in
government, as well as people

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,930
that are using robotics and art,
or philosophers that discuss

10
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,190
robotics, really anyone that I
think will make an interesting

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,300
interview for you all.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,970
This podcast is going to be for
roboticists, as well as anyone

13
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,750
that is interested in robotics,
but doesn't necessarily have any

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,850
robotics knowledge. So for
roboticists, we hope that this

15
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,810
podcast helps them understand
different things that are

16
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,190
happening in robotics, outside
of their own focused area.

17
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,440
For everyone else, those without
robotics backgrounds. We hope

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,890
that this is an accessible way
to understand what's going on in

19
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:22,580
robotics, as well as its
limitations, and potential. And

20
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,760
one way that we're going to make
this podcast accessible is to

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,100
explain technical concepts as we
go. So that way, we don't leave

22
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,290
anyone in the dark. This is also
good for roboticist because this

23
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,440
is a very large field and
someone from legged mocha

24
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,870
locomotion may not understand
terms used by the computer

25
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,400
vision community say.

26
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,760
Now, this podcast is sponsored
by Open Robotics, which is where

27
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:58,100
I work as a software engineer.
Open Robotics makes open source

28
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,250
robotic software, you may be
familiar with their robot

29
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,470
operating system (ROS), or their
simulator, Ignition Gazebo. This

30
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,860
podcast isn't going to be
limited talk to talking about

31
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:15,830
topics that relate to things
that open robotics makes. So we

32
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,510
have free rein to talk about
everything.

33
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,860
For me, I have been involved in
robotics for maybe eight years,

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,300
mostly as a researcher in
academia. As I mentioned, I'm

35
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,470
currently working at Open
Robotics. And I was previously

36
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,990
involved in Robohub's robot
podcast, where I led it for

37
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:41,660
maybe five years. And I'm very
happy for this opportunity and

38
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,700
the support of Open Robotics to
make this podcast, very excited

39
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,840
to try longer interviews. And I
just enjoyed learning through

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,720
conducting interviews and
sharing that with the greater

41
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,260
public.

42
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,550
So next, where do we get the
name Sense Think Act Podcast? So

43
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,490
robots can be thought of as
machines that sense the world.

44
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,900
Think about what they see, and
then act upon the world, maybe

45
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,870
by moving themselves or by
moving something else, for

46
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:21,770
example. And in school, many
roboticists were probably taught

47
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,310
that this is a fundamental
control loop that you can think

48
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,120
of for roboticist. So because
this is going to be a general

49
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,000
robotics podcast, we thought it
was an appropriate name.

50
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,120
Now, you can watch this podcast
on YouTube and maybe Vimeo in

51
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,450
the near future. And you should
be able to listen to this

52
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,260
podcast on all major podcasting
platforms such as Apple

53
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,160
Podcasts, Spotify, Google
Podcasts, etc.

54
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,580
For comments, you can of course,
comment on YouTube. But we will

55
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,470
be using the ROS Discourse for
comments with the category since

56
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,810
think act. And you can you can
leave comments there, such as

57
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,200
thoughts on a specific episode,
or general feedback or

58
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,820
suggestions on things you would
like us to cover. Now you can

59
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,360
also access that through the
sense think act website at

60
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:23,840
SenseThinkAct.com. And well,
that's all I have for today. So

61
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,860
thank you to our founding
sponsor, Open Robotics, and I'll

62
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,460
see you every two weeks for a
new interview. Make sure to

63
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,920
subscribe if you want
notifications. Goodbye,

64
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,460
everyone.
