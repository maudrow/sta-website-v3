00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,410
Audrow Nash: Hi, everyone.
Welcome to the Sensing Think

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,280
Act Podcast. I'm the host Audrow
Nash. And in this episode I

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,900
interview Adrian Macneil, co
founder and CEO of Foxglove,

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,320
Foxglove makes Foxglove Studio,
which is an open source

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,610
visualization debugging tool for
robotics. In this interview,

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,540
Adrian and I talk about the
origin of Foxglove, Foxglove's

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,310
business model, web technologies
and robotics, the timeline for

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,700
autonomous cars, and Adrian
gives advice for those

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,090
interested in getting more
involved in robotics. I really

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,150
enjoyed talking to Adrian, he
has an interesting perspective

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,090
on technology and seems to be
involved in interesting

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,510
technologies, right as they're
coming up. For example, He was

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:52,080
an early employee at Coinbase,
and Cruise. As always, a big

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,290
thank you to our founding
sponsor, Open Robotics, and I

15
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:55,980
hope you enjoy.

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,670
Hi, Adrian, would you introduce
yourself? Hi, I'm

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,730
Adrian Macneil: Adrian Macneil,
founder and CEO of Foxglove.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,460
Audrow Nash: Now, tell me a bit
about foxglove what it does and

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,500
what problem it's solving. And
then I'd love to get into the

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,790
backstory of that after.

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,230
Adrian Macneil: Yeah,
definitely. So foxglove is a

22
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:24,060
developer tools company for
robotics. We have our main

23
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,000
product right now is an open
source visualization platform

24
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,410
for robotics. And it's browser
based cross platform. We can

25
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,620
allow you to really dive into
your robotics data understanding

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,040
of your sense of editing and
planning, visualize things like

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,080
point clouds, images, overlays,
markers, bounding boxes, plots,

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,210
and drill into kind of raw
messages

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,270
Audrow Nash: and you guys you
interface tightly with the robot

30
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,090
operating system or ROS
ecosystem, correct?

31
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,830
Adrian Macneil: Right? Yeah,
correct. So we we work very well

32
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,400
with ROS. We don't we're not
strictly limited to Russell

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,220
though. That's definitely our
best supported platform right

34
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,450
now. We do allow you to connect
other types of data sources like

35
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,810
for example, we can connect just
to a velodyne LIDAR and and talk

36
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,150
directly to that sensor and
visualize data coming off the

37
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,750
sensor. But when you're in a
ROS environment, we can

38
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,210
obviously make a connection to
ROS and then we have a lot of

39
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,690
custom visualizations that help
you understand ROS messages

40
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,420
like point clouds and images and
other things like

41
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,720
Audrow Nash: how does it compare
to existing ROS tools like ARV

42
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,290
is our ROS visualizer for
visualization?

43
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,430
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, so yeah,
so we have I would say the

44
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,420
biggest difference is that it's
cross platform and using a web

45
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,030
based stack that was something
you know, we can get into the

46
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,020
origin a little bit that that
was something that was kind of a

47
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,900
key underpinning of building
this technology is that we

48
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,260
wanted to work with a browser
based stack which means that

49
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,110
they can run cross platform we
actually have desktop apps that

50
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,290
you can install on your computer
that run on Mac Windows and

51
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,350
Linux equally well and then you
can also access it in the

52
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,180
browser. So that you know that
makes it like very easy to just

53
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,660
jump into an environment and
start debugging it also kind of

54
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,960
unlocks that something that I
think is as important to me as

55
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,410
breaking robotics development
out of being stuck with like

56
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,940
Linux desktops and you know
Linux is great but a lot of

57
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,420
robotics development now is very
the software the developing is

58
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,030
like very tied to the platform
that you're developing on and

59
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,900
you know if you're using ROS
Vision X you know ROS galactic

60
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,820
you need to be using Ubuntu 2004
and you know that's the only

61
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,130
choice you have you pretty much
stuck with that for your

62
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,720
development handle and get
developed well

63
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,899
Audrow Nash: it does work so
galactic and many of the other

64
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:48,749
ROS two distributions also work
on Windows not very well I think

65
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:53,069
tier three support for Mac this
kind of thing Yeah, but

66
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:56,369
Adrian Macneil: yeah, it's
getting there I did say yeah,

67
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:56,879
you're right.

68
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,690
Audrow Nash: But this was this
was definitely which was kind of

69
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:06,900
the origin of like foxglove was
a rough one. Or Weber's Yeah, we

70
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,320
Adrian Macneil: support both
ROS one roster Yeah. But yeah,

71
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,380
for sure our windows support is
out there. Although you know,

72
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,720
most of the people I've seen
doing ROS development on

73
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,050
windows are using the windows
subsystem for Linux so they're

74
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,990
actually still running you know,
the actual Linux version. Oh,

75
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,250
that's fine. And then yeah, and
then Mac actually you know, Mac

76
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,740
came out I think ROS two
initially came out and said

77
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,630
we're gonna suppose a lot of
work. Yeah. Like no one kind of

78
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:40,620
stepped up to volunteer. Yeah,
so the and the actual you know,

79
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,990
code that you're writing big
Linux only is fine, right? Oh,

80
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,630
we want to break out of as the
developer tools so there's no

81
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,450
reason that you can't be on a
Mac developing inside a Docker

82
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,620
container. But But your actual
tools to like visualizing

83
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,200
things, it's, you know, those
graphical tools are going to be

84
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,630
easier if you can just connect
to them from a browser or

85
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,970
connect or, you know, fire up a
native emulator.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,180
Audrow Nash: what's the what's
the big win? Or what are some of

87
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,100
the big wins doing it browser
based as opposed to like qT? or

88
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,990
something, which is what ARV is
uses?

89
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,920
Adrian Macneil: Yeah. Yeah,
yeah. And I think I should jump

90
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,040
into some of the other things to
talk to the browser based thing.

91
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,930
And then also some of the other
things that kind of

92
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,560
differentiate us with with
Office and Matthew two things.

93
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,370
browser based, I think, you
know, there's a few points

94
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,000
there. One is that it's it's
inherently cross platform, you

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,640
know, the browser is a really
great environment where, you

96
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,860
know, as long as you fire up
your browser and go to a

97
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,530
website, you can pretty much
expect the same experience,

98
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,850
regardless of what platform
you're on. That makes it really

99
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,150
good as you're scaling a
robotics team. You know, if you

100
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,310
start out with just one or two
people, you're working on a

101
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,430
project, that's, that's, you
know, it's fine if you've got a

102
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,610
pretty custom environment set up
on your computer. But as you

103
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,130
scale up that team, you want
people to just be able to, you

104
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,000
know, on board start working on
the code base, you know, being

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,400
able to like visit a URL and
look at things directly is

106
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,030
really great. And then another
point there is that it makes it

107
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,950
really easy for you to access
remote data as well, right? So

108
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,830
we can, you know, get into
talking about data storage a

109
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,520
little bit as well. But a lot of
the times, you know, the state

110
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,400
of the art and robotics today, a
lot of people are just storing,

111
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,760
you know, huge 100 gig bag files
on a computer, and then I've

112
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,700
been trying to debug it. And
that's ROS bag. You want to

113
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,590
share this, my friend? Yeah.

114
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,030
Audrow Nash: And ROS, too. It's
an SQL lite database. Right. And

115
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,440
I forget what it is in Roscoe,
and

116
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,940
Adrian Macneil: yeah, it's just
a custom format, bag. Bag file

117
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,240
format. That's just basically
your ROS message. But having

118
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,720
Audrow Nash: a big monolithic
data storage, basically.

119
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,040
Massive.

120
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,770
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, yeah,
yeah. And so those can get

121
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,560
really huge if you're dealing
with multiple cameras,

122
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,290
especially if you start getting
into LIDAR and point clouds and

123
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,410
radars and sensors, bossier.
We're also recording all of the

124
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,400
other messages that ROS is
sending back and forth. And so,

125
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,530
you know, a lot of people are
working with these files

126
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,530
locally. But sharing that among
team members is really

127
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,220
challenging. It's, you know, a
case of like, either just get

128
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,090
someone to wait here over and
have a look at your desk. Or you

129
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,210
know, you can't, you can't just
like share a link in slack and

130
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,580
have someone else click on that
and immediately start looking at

131
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,600
it. So that's, that's where we
kind of see the browser's really

132
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,730
unlocking these workflows where
you can just click on data.

133
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,160
Audrow Nash: And is that talking
about having data storage

134
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,270
happening in the browser?

135
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,190
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, yeah. So
not always, I mean, the data

136
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,410
storage happening on a server?
Yeah. For sure, yeah. Yeah. But

137
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,740
yeah, once you get to having a
data stored in a centralized

138
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,830
location, and the browser can
just easily be streaming that,

139
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,500
you know, it just makes the
whole internet experience

140
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,180
really, really compelling.

141
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,420
Audrow Nash: Let's see. So I
feel like this is a good time to

142
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,470
get into the origin story of
foxglove. So can you tell me

143
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,160
where it started?

144
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,340
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, sure. So I
spent the last five years prior

145
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,680
to this cruise, building self
driving cars. And I led

146
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,200
basically all of the developer
tools and infrastructure there.

147
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,560
So when I joined, it was, you
know, a very small company,

148
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,450
maybe 40 4050 people or so over
the over that period, we grew

149
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,120
into the sort of 1000 plus
range, I think it was around

150
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:32,850
1700, when I left out, and you
know, over that time, or the

151
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:37,110
engineering team grew right
from, from 20 people to well

152
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,090
over 1000. And so, you know,
they they started, as you know,

153
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,550
I'm sure a lot of our products
company, so it was a ROS stack

154
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,410
originally, on ROS one, and you
have a bunch of people just, you

155
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,650
know, contributing code,
building features, testing

156
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,400
things out. But as you scale
that and 100 and 1000 plus

157
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,830
engineers, do you really need to
start getting a lot more

158
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,980
disciplined around the developer
productivity? What tools are you

159
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,350
making available to people? What
are the workflows that you

160
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:10,800
encourage people to do? You
know, the less you standardize

161
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,050
things, I guess the more pain
you're in for as you start

162
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,070
getting into 1000 plus engineers
contributing to a project.

163
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:22,499
Audrow Nash: Yeah. And so crews
had an internal effort to make

164
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:25,919
something for visualization,
rather than using the standard

165
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,629
ROS one arvis. Or our Qt graph.
Yeah. Anything?

166
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,690
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, for sure.
It started out as as visit

167
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,900
Accutane. As I mentioned, they
started out on a ROS one

168
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,200
platform, positive ROS
definitely gotten kind of

169
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,690
switched out over time and
replaced with in house things.

170
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,890
But in the early days, everyone
was just using, you know, the

171
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:52,770
standard tools like ours. And
the project that we that we

172
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,170
kicked off with visualization
there. I think we started back

173
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,160
in about 2017. It came out of a
hackathon actually it was not

174
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,130
instead of a top down approach
of you know, this is something

175
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,490
we think we need to invest in,
it was just something that some

176
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,250
engineers really felt needed to
exist and really felt would

177
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:13,770
would kind of streamline the
workflow. So yeah, that was kind

178
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,220
of the origin of width is which,
you know, some people may be

179
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,110
familiar with, they presented
with us at ROS con in 2019, I

180
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,340
think it was eventually open
sourced in 2019. But back in

181
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:31,050
2017, it really just started as,
you know, some engineers on the

182
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,170
team feeling that that we could,
you know, we could do better on

183
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,220
a couple of aspects. One is, you
know, bringing these tools to

184
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,520
the web where it's a lot easier
for, for, you know, people to

185
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,590
contribute to, like easier to
find engineers.

186
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:49,199
Audrow Nash: Easier to
contribute to it or easier to,

187
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,859
for people, why is web easier
for people to contribute to?

188
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,820
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, I mean, I
guess, you know, that could be a

189
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,830
bit of a loaded statement,
because obviously, if you're

190
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,520
familiar with c++ development
and development, then it's going

191
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,160
to be a lot harder for you
personally, to contribute to but

192
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,340
you know, on a scale of, of
larger commercial engineering

193
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:14,850
teams, it's, on average, a lot
easier to find front end and

194
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,290
JavaScript engineers who can
build web applications. There's

195
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,930
just, you know, a much larger
pool of people that you can draw

196
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,780
Audrow Nash: from, would you
guess the order? Is there like,

197
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,090
there's 10 times more people
that are familiar with

198
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:32,670
JavaScript than c++ or I mean,
just ballpark for these kinds of

199
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,950
jobs? Yeah, I think it's 10. Or,
like this order of magnitude,

200
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,600
Adrian Macneil: probably in the
Bay Area. That wouldn't be far

201
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,940
off. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I
haven't seen any numbers

202
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,020
specifically on it. But yeah,
anecdotally going out to hire a

203
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:55,170
front end engineer versus a c++
engineer who has experience

204
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,320
experience. Yeah, Qt experience
and things like that. Like for

205
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,840
sure there's a lot of really
talented c++ engineers out

206
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,530
there, but not so much. On the
visualization side, there's this

207
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,900
argument that I've, you know,
done game development and things

208
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,880
like that. But yeah, just just
much easier for, especially once

209
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,600
your company, you start building
a lot of internal tools, usually

210
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,140
a lot of internal tools are web
based. And I don't want to push

211
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,980
on, on being easy to contribute
to is like, the main thing, but

212
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,800
it's that combined with the fact
that anyone at the company can

213
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,020
just hit a URL and access that
you don't need to worry about

214
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,460
like deploying this app across
your team. And also, you know,

215
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,220
there was something that was
important to us was being able

216
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,460
to like unify these various
tools into one interface. So

217
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,890
Audrow Nash: you mean are? Like,

218
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,190
Adrian Macneil: yeah, yeah,
exactly. So are you able to

219
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:44,430
bring

220
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:46,439
Audrow Nash: speak to what each
does just a little bit?

221
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,829
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, yeah. So
avars is primarily a 3d based

222
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:56,909
visualization tool. So you can
go in and you can, you can open

223
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,069
up some data, and you can look
at where your model is sitting

224
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:03,059
in the world. And you can see
sensor data. And you can see,

225
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:06,059
you know, three name markers, 3d
bounding boxes, and things like

226
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:10,409
that. You can see things like
your transforms like the shape

227
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:14,129
of your robot, and you know,
where your robot is relative to

228
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:15,629
something that it's trying to
act on.

229
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,930
Audrow Nash: And if I understand
correctly, it's not a 3d

230
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,260
simulator. It's more just 3d
visualization. There's no

231
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,300
physics engine associated with
it.

232
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,240
Adrian Macneil: Right? Right.
Right, exactly. So it's purely

233
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,450
taking necessarily information
from a robot, and then just

234
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,690
showing you, you know, how your
robot is thinking, and the world

235
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:39,450
is gonna have an insight into
your robot. And then you have,

236
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,050
you know, acuity is sort of a
collection of tools that you can

237
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,230
open a standard one on Windows,
or you can kind of open them in

238
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,040
a sort of attached panel
configuration. And it comes with

239
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,730
a handful of other tools, which
can give you things like reading

240
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,310
diagnostics, from a robot
reading direct messages from a

241
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,360
robot, reading plots from a
robot or reading plots, but

242
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,430
displaying plots based on data
from your robot. And then you

243
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,430
start seeing that there's other
tools in law recently that have

244
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,610
come out like plot juggler and
things, you know, a separate

245
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:16,530
again. And so yeah, that was
kind of one of our insights, I

246
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:20,009
Audrow Nash: guess, cruise to
combine them.

247
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:22,859
Adrian Macneil: And one of my
early in one of my early days

248
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:26,009
there I have a vivid memory of
attending we so we had Friday

249
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:29,639
demos, basically, every weekend,
people could jump up and kind of

250
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,509
just show something called what
they've built. And someone from

251
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:36,599
the QA team jumped up and demoed
the script that they've written

252
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:41,789
that would basically take a bag
file and then open it, start

253
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:44,969
ROS in the background, and then
launch about like 12 different

254
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:47,819
windows on your screen and
rearrange them into position so

255
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:53,999
that you'd be ready to start
debugging. And I was like, you

256
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:56,309
know, and they got a standing
ovation for that right because

257
00:14:56,309 --> 00:15:00,449
it was so much. Such a massive
time saver compared to Compared

258
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:02,759
to like, manually going through
that process and you know,

259
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,309
taking a backfile and wanting
ROS and then opening these

260
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:09,419
various windows, you know, I
just remember that so vividly

261
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:13,469
because it's, it's, it's, you
know, like seeing the pain of

262
00:15:13,469 --> 00:15:15,809
how difficult it is just to get
to the point where you're

263
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:18,779
actually getting your work done.
It's like, this is not, this is

264
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,369
just like admin before you
actually get

265
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:23,999
Audrow Nash: 20 minutes of work
before you can start work.

266
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,720
Adrian Macneil: Right. Right.
And, you know, and that's

267
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,790
actually sort of another
difference that another point of

268
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,140
differentiation we took is that,
you know, the tools like others

269
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,950
are, they're very coupled with
ROS. So you have to have ROS,

270
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,190
you run ROS, in the background,
you stone, your ROS stack, and

271
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,100
then you start others, and
others will talk to ROS, and

272
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,530
it'll show you kind of exactly
what's happening. And if you

273
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,620
want to play back a bag file,
playback recording that you

274
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:55,110
have, then you need to play that
back into ROS. And then kind of

275
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,180
you'll see it as like a
byproduct of

276
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,270
Audrow Nash: going over the ROS
network, basically.

277
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,430
Adrian Macneil: Right, right.
Everything's kind of going over

278
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,850
the ROS network. And, again,
when you start thinking about

279
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,550
different workflows across the
company, you have QA engineers,

280
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,070
and they have a look at right.

281
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,120
Audrow Nash: So they want to
talk up to good quality, and

282
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,020
we're doing things well.

283
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,230
Adrian Macneil: Okay, right,
right, exactly. And if they're

284
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,660
taking let's say, there's an
incident where, you know,

285
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,510
something that happened on the
road, right? We pulled out this

286
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,240
or not, we got too close to a
cyclist, or we, you know,

287
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,590
whatever we did, and you've been
assigned to triage, an engineer

288
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,260
has been assigned to that kind
of triage this and figure out,

289
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:38,460
maybe not like, what is the root
cause just yet, but where do we

290
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,690
think the likely root causes?
You want to be able to just

291
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,690
like, open that kind of incident
directly and start looking at

292
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:45,990
it? You

293
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,340
Audrow Nash: know, you're saying
that the incident? Yeah, yes.

294
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,010
rosbank file or okay.

295
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,890
Adrian Macneil: Right, right.
But you want to, like, what you

296
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:00,420
actually want to do is get into
visualizing that incident as

297
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,450
quickly as possible. And you
don't, you know, the fact that

298
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,610
there steps like downloading a
bag file,

299
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:09,749
Audrow Nash: which is huge.
codebase, which is huge,

300
00:17:09,749 --> 00:17:12,119
probably. So it probably takes

301
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,860
Adrian Macneil: a while to like
100 gigabyte

302
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,110
Audrow Nash: uploads are often
slow. You get it from a thumb

303
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,410
drive.

304
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:23,729
Adrian Macneil: Okay, yeah, tell
you all about No. So it's just a

305
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:26,039
process, right, kind of take
that back file, and you bring it

306
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:28,139
down to your computer, and then
you open up, you know, check out

307
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:30,539
the code base, and you go back
to the version of the code base

308
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:32,849
that you had last week that was
actually running on and then you

309
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:35,669
launch ROS launch hours, and
like, now you're looking at the

310
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:39,089
data. And, you know, we just
wanted to simplify the whole

311
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:41,339
process. So it's like, you click
on the link, and then you're

312
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:42,389
looking at it immediately.

313
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,880
Audrow Nash: Yeah, that is way
easier, where you can just open

314
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,300
it. And so you, and then this
gets into the cross platform and

315
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,410
everything because they could be
on any computer. And they don't

316
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,500
need to spend their money for OS
installed. And they don't need

317
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,030
to have ROS bag installed.

318
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,750
Adrian Macneil: Just run it on a
Chromebook or something and

319
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,820
just, you know, immediately jump
into things.

320
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:11,340
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Okay, so
then I see the motivation for

321
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,690
this quite clearly. So you were
at cruise, and you were working

322
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,710
on web servers. And you had this
experience where someone

323
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,670
automated some of the setup that
they might go through when

324
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,340
trying to do some debugging. And
that was like an aha moment for

325
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,650
you. And then is that how web is
started?

326
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:38,700
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, and, you
know, to clarify, I guess I, I

327
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,790
was the director of engineering,
so I didn't like contribute

328
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,720
much, or anything to the webfest
card itself that the team was

329
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,220
under me, but all the talented
engineers did the work not, not

330
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:56,280
me. But you know, I very much
agreed with the vision of of

331
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,250
what they were trying to achieve
there. And I think, you know,

332
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,190
we, the team that was working on
that there was some really

333
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,120
talented engineers, they kind of
made a proof of concept. Like I

334
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,210
said, at a hackathon. They went
around, you know, a handful of

335
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,830
different teams, and kind of
went team by him and said, Hey,

336
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,990
you know, what problems you're
having with your tools? How can

337
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,840
we solve them with your
visualization, and just

338
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,750
incorporated all of the various
workflows that were happening

339
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:26,190
across the company into this one
tool. And so, you know, over

340
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,970
that period of a year or so, it
just became kind of an

341
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,210
indispensable that everyone was
using at the company. And that

342
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:38,490
really just opened my eyes up to
you know, how much of a

343
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,880
productivity boost a good
quality visualization tool could

344
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,380
be. And, you know, that's what
ultimately led us to consulting.

345
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:54,060
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. And so you
open sourced web is and then now

346
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,230
you are with foxglove. Can you
tell me a bit about that

347
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,860
transition

348
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,750
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, yeah, for
sure. So we open sourced my

349
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,760
visit cruise in around 2019. The
goal there was to, you know,

350
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,530
give back to the community. And,
you know, also just to put some

351
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,890
of that code out there as as,
you know, engineers working on

352
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,610
projects that companies quite
often you want to just put, you

353
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,500
know, anything that's not sort
of like, tied critical IP to the

354
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,230
company. Yeah, yeah, critical
company secrets, it's always

355
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,570
nice to be able to publish
things. And we published a lot

356
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,270
of open source code occurs
around, you know, even just

357
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,610
unrelated things, like how we're
managing our Kubernetes

358
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,510
infrastructure and things like
that. But, you know, we put

359
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,880
those out there, and it was
available for the community to

360
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,710
use. And, you know, they
presented a Roscommon 2019, I

361
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,640
think, and, you know, picked up
a bit of steam. Certainly people

362
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,890
were out there using it. But I
guess, you know, here's where I

363
00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:00,690
would draw differentiation
between non open source coders

364
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,570
create an equal, I guess there's
a difference between kind of

365
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,690
code that is public versus
actual communities that are

366
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:11,490
being built. And, you know, I
don't vote Cruz for this in any

367
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,760
way. I think Chris is absolutely
making the right decisions for

368
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,910
their own prioritization and
things. But, I mean, I was like

369
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:22,500
part of these decision making
but but Chris doesn't have time

370
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,160
to build features and weathers
that are not useful to crews,

371
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,980
for example, you know, they have
the project out there, but like,

372
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,470
no one is building ROS 2
support and the weapons are

373
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:31,920
known as

374
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,680
Audrow Nash: their stack is rock
one, or

375
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,250
Adrian Macneil: stack now. I
mean, the stacks kind of, you

376
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:43,050
know, hitting off in a different
direction entirely. So, you

377
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,510
know, it's the code was out
there, and it was available for

378
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,320
people to use, but there was
never a kind of a pretense that

379
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,710
crews wanted to sort of invest
heavily in building a community

380
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,740
and adding features that were
like, not useful to them at all.

381
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,950
Like I say, this is, you know,
absolutely the right decision.

382
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,010
If you're, if you're, the
purpose of your company, is get

383
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,590
a self driving car going in San
Francisco, you know, the purpose

384
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,830
of the company is not build
unrelated kind of open source

385
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,920
communities and invest heavily
in that sometimes that happens,

386
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,630
you know, if you're a company
the size of Facebook, and then

387
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,900
you build something like react
exactly like, shot, you have

388
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,990
hundreds of 1000s of employees,
and you can spare a small team

389
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,780
of 30 to work on XYZ thing, but

390
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,240
Audrow Nash: it's crazy. It's
really that small. Yeah, that

391
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,210
makes sense. But yeah, I didn't
know. It could Yeah, or

392
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,620
something. Was that just guess
yeah.

393
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,620
Adrian Macneil: But yeah, it's
Yeah, it's, it's when you're a

394
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,830
sufficiently large company, you
can kind of afford to make those

395
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,280
bets. But for the majority of
companies out there, you're, you

396
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,730
know, when they're open sourcing
code, it's usually sort of isn't

397
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,390
code that we wrote, use it if
you like it, but we're not

398
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,950
supporting it. still focused on
my internal needs. Yeah. Makes

399
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,790
sense. Yeah. So that's, you
know, that's what ultimately led

400
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,990
to foxglove. We had a lot of
chances, the windows team with

401
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,800
courage and leadership and
several other weapons team are

402
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,360
working Foxcroft now. But we
wanted to make a clean break, I

403
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,460
guess we, you know, another bit
of context, as to the weapons,

404
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,520
as it exists today is pretty
tightly coupled with a lot of

405
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,140
internal crew systems. So the
open source version of weapons

406
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,000
is only you know, only about
half of the code and weapons is

407
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,390
actually open source, right. And
the rest of it is special custom

408
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,350
source that exists inside our
crews. And those two are quite

409
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:40,170
tightly intertwined. It's not
sort of super easy. For us, as

410
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,990
founding foxglove, it's not
super easy for us to go and kind

411
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,800
of contribute back to that
project without having access to

412
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,180
all of the closed source things.
Yep. Makes sense. So we made the

413
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,940
decision, when we founded Fox
five at the start of this year

414
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,950
that we wanted to kind of carry
on weathers in spirit. And you

415
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,490
know, we use the we forked the
code base originally, which

416
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,890
means we took that code base,
and we're basically saying, you

417
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,830
know, where versus here, it's,
it's the open source version of

418
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,280
web, this is not really
undergoing a lot of significant

419
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,580
changes. Right now, most of the
team that still works on that

420
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:19,230
occurs is primarily focused on
career specific additions that

421
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,500
are not open source yet. But you
know, we said we're gonna, we're

422
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,080
gonna just, you know, we want to
continue this in the spirit, but

423
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,660
we're going to, it's going to
become a different product over

424
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:32,430
time. And we don't want to sort
of create kind of confusion

425
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,010
there. We just want to say, Hey,
we're building Foxtrot. We're

426
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,990
using some of the stuff that was
done in the past. we're

427
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,360
incorporating a whole bunch of
Elon ideas, but we're not kind

428
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,250
of being held back by what's of
company technical. Yeah,

429
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,040
exactly, like company interests,
or just like, you know,

430
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,970
technical limitations around how
how projects are kind of tied to

431
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:51,810
internal code.

432
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:56,969
Audrow Nash: Yep. And how did
you decide to form a company

433
00:24:56,969 --> 00:25:01,199
around this as opposed to any of
these Other things that you

434
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,959
could have done like you could
have just been a side project or

435
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:07,589
like, decide to jump on and run?
Yeah,

436
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,200
Adrian Macneil: I guess? Yeah,
that's a really good question. I

437
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,270
think, I believe very strongly
in the future of robotics. I

438
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:18,270
think, you know, there's an
enormous industry out there for

439
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,790
our enormous opportunity out
there for robotics to just

440
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:25,110
completely change. What our
economy looks like, what society

441
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,050
looks like, I think, you know, I
think people are massively under

442
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:31,080
estimating how much robotics is
going to impact the next 10 or

443
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:38,910
20 years of kind of human life.
And I also really believe that

444
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:43,140
high quality, you know, I love
engineering, productivity,

445
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,620
development, productivity, I
believe that high quality tools

446
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,310
can help people focus on doing
what they do best. And I've

447
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:53,490
seen, you know, I've seen that
kurzen and other companies I've

448
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:58,830
seen, really talented engineers
are, like deep, deep domain

449
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:03,060
experts struggle and spend 80%
of their time fighting with

450
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,310
something that they don't
properly understand. Because

451
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:09,930
it's not, it's not their
expertise. And, you know,

452
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,010
likewise, I guess that's where I
always felt that I and others

453
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,000
can kind of contribute, because,
you know, I'm not, I'm not kind

454
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,600
of, you know, controls PhD or
machine learning PhD or anything

455
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:27,870
like I don't claim to be a
super. Right, but I can tell you

456
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,480
how, like build systems work and
data works and and systems

457
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,970
brought together and
visualization and how these kind

458
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:37,050
of things work. And I really
believe that kind of, you know,

459
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,830
good quality tooling means that
domain experts can all focus on

460
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,140
kind of their, their area of
expertise.

461
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,280
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So you're
basically making it easier for

462
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,740
people to work on what they are
good at.

463
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,420
Adrian Macneil: Right, exactly.
And yeah, and then so that, I

464
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,970
guess, tying it back to your
question was, you know, how did

465
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,860
that leave the founding box live
was that we were foxtel. If we

466
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,050
wanted to, you know,
visualization, that's where

467
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,930
we're starting. But the ultimate
goal of our slogan is to make

468
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,300
robotics development easier,
right? We want to be able to

469
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,680
help roboticists focus on their
domain problems, focus on on

470
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,530
shipping products, and not worry
about, you know, how they're

471
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,110
thinking about their tools and
their data and their development

472
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:23,250
workflow and all of these
things. So the visualization

473
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:27,210
pace was our starting point,
because I believe that there's

474
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,670
just, you know, such big, low
hanging fruit there. It's

475
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:33,240
something that we selfie, so
impactful at cruise, but you

476
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,090
know, we have kind of a roadmap
of other areas that we also

477
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,170
really think we can help them.

478
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:41,549
Audrow Nash: Awesome. I'm
interested to talk about that.

479
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:48,809
But first, you also had a lot of
several people go from cruise to

480
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:51,989
working at Box club with you.
Would you tell me a bit about

481
00:27:51,989 --> 00:27:52,319
that?

482
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,620
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, so we, my
co founder, and I both. So my co

483
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,370
founder, Roman, he's our CTO, we
have worked together for a long

484
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,710
time, we actually worked
together before careers, we

485
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,780
worked together for years before
careers, we work together at

486
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,760
Coinbase. And that was where we
met. So I was an early

487
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,430
engineering hire, and the first
head of engineering and

488
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:19,710
Coinbase, back in back in the
early days. And yeah, we met

489
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,920
there. We worked together for a
long time, he was actually the

490
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,050
one that introduced me to
careers and convince me to come

491
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:30,210
there. And then so you know, we
really wanted to do something

492
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,650
together around robotics,
developer tools, we got chatting

493
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:39,060
to a few folks. Many, you know,
several of our team members have

494
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:44,070
come from careers. Mostly not
directly, I guess, you know,

495
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:47,640
like I said, it was sort of five
years since I or more now since

496
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,750
I started at Chris or Robin,
and, you know, several of the

497
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,400
other folks on our team had come
from, had been at cruise for,

498
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,680
you know, two or three years and
then had gone to other

499
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:03,300
companies, products like this.
And then, you know, we kind of

500
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,780
just reconnected with a bunch of
people on our network and to see

501
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,800
who would be interested.

502
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:12,480
Audrow Nash: Sorry, Siri popped
up. Why would you say, for the

503
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:12,840
last?

504
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,320
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, just just
that we, you know, all of those

505
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,590
people had been that had been
that curse. And then had gone on

506
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,680
to work at other companies. And
we just reconnected with, with

507
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,500
some folks in our network to see
her. You know, I was interested

508
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,140
in doing something around this.
Yeah.

509
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,990
Audrow Nash: And now, you said
you strongly believe in the

510
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,530
future of robotics. Would you
just tell me a bit more about

511
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,740
that, like, what is making you
so optimistic about the future

512
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,430
of robotics?

513
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:46,500
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, I mean,
it's, it's, it's inevitable,

514
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:51,990
right? You see. I mean, and
partly, maybe this comes from

515
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,710
having worked their careers and
seeing what is possible. I

516
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,990
think, you know, a lot of people
haven't really had that glimpse

517
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,110
into what is possible, but when
you do Sit in a car that's

518
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:04,050
driving itself around a busy
intersection with, you know,

519
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,320
potentially hundreds of people
walking around it and cyclists

520
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,790
and cars and, you know, you see
a car that can, I mean, I was,

521
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,540
you know, six, seven years ago
very skeptical about self

522
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,500
driving cars. But you know,
having having gone on scene and

523
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,900
setting those cars and seeing
the progress that's made and

524
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,560
seeing things that, you know,
you hear people while you're

525
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,510
talking to people on the street
that have not worked in the

526
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,820
industry, and they say, Well, I
don't think it's after because

527
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,620
of course it won't because
sometimes you just need to be

528
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:36,120
able to understand you know, one
of the other humans doing and

529
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,820
then you see the team was just
plugging away at problems like

530
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,650
you know, a four way stop sign
is a very common in America, we

531
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,740
have we, you know, cars have to
basically take turns and giving

532
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:52,110
way to each other. And
especially in San Francisco, you

533
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,260
have to be quite assertive in a
four way stop sign up to a stop

534
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:00,000
sign. And you know, technically
it's your right away if you got

535
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,190
there first and someone else got
there half a second later. But

536
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,150
if you don't start pulling out
into that intersection, you

537
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,390
know, the other car is gonna is
gonna go very quickly, right? So

538
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,570
you look at these problems and
you know, you start thinking

539
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,000
about people signaling and
things like that, but but he

540
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,640
seems like chip away at these
problems and get to a point

541
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,150
where they've tuned the car
where you know, as as the cars

542
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,790
turns coming up, it has like a
very human like behavior where

543
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,000
it pulls forward slightly to
kind of indicate its intention

544
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,960
that it's going to go and that
actually causes the other cars

545
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,420
not to pull out because they
they can kind of see your

546
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,450
intention that you're planning
on going and you know, these

547
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,660
these things, they sound like
very human behaviors, but you

548
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,540
can actually just really get
down into into kind of encoding

549
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,290
and machine learning models or,
or even you know, hard coded

550
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,680
logic in some cases where the
car is like exhibiting very

551
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,150
human like Vega so yeah, it's,
it's really interesting, you

552
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:58,020
kind of see, see that evolve,
and then you look around the

553
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,490
world, and you just see how many
things done, how many sort of,

554
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,510
you know, tasks, or jobs are
done by humans today that are

555
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:10,830
both like a, like, very
interesting, very repetitive,

556
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:15,240
you know, couldn't be done
better, more reliably cheaper by

557
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,540
machines? And the kicker is that
they're way easier than driving

558
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:23,040
around San Francisco. Yeah, so
like, you know, this is great

559
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,140
course, you know, the future is
here, it's just not on

560
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,410
definitely, it's not evenly
distributed, right? It's, it's

561
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:32,280
like it's just inevitable to me
that the launch of burgers is

562
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,700
going to if you took all the
technology that was currently

563
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,180
being developed and self driving
cars and apply that to, you

564
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:43,050
know, warehouses, logistics,
manufacturing, agriculture,

565
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,030
shipping like this, you know,
food prep for production,

566
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:53,220
there's, there's so many areas
where all of these environments

567
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,120
are much more constrained than
then, you know, driving around a

568
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,120
city. And if you took 1000
engineers and apply that to

569
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,840
that, there's no doubt that
those loads will be solved. You

570
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,080
know, very quickly, the thing
is, right now, there's not that,

571
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,230
I guess, you know, economic
investment is not there to put

572
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,410
1000 engineers on a problem
about self driving forklift or

573
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,170
something. We're certainly
getting there. But it's not at

574
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:20,310
that scale yet. But you get this
kind of flywheel effect where as

575
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,200
more people start trying to
solve those problems, better

576
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,270
tools come along, better
frameworks come along, better

577
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,340
libraries come along, there's
more off the shelf that people

578
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,730
can use, you know, the flywheel
start spinning, and then teams

579
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,340
of 10 engineers can all of a
sudden have the output of

580
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:37,830
October 1000, you know, a decade
earlier. So yeah, just, I mean,

581
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,130
that's what makes me so I guess,
so interested in optimistic

582
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,400
about the future of robotics is
just that, you know, it's, it's,

583
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,790
it's going to have a massive
impact. And I think that people

584
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:52,080
are, I think it's really kind of
reached the public consciousness

585
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,330
yet, you know, everyone's
talking about blockchains. And

586
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:00,090
AI. You know, I think like,
robotics is kind of the defining

587
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:05,160
application of AI maybe, and
people haven't really sort of

588
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,810
grasp that yet, I think.

589
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,380
Audrow Nash: Do you? So you
mentioned several, like, I don't

590
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:18,600
know, domains, agriculture,
manufacturing, etc. Are there

591
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:24,540
any specific areas within those
are any specific problems that

592
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,150
you think are particularly
interesting and ripe to be

593
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,260
solved by robotics?

594
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:32,340
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, yeah, I've
seen some very interesting stuff

595
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,930
happening. You know, and
warehouses, like, Fetch robotics

596
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:40,620
are doing really interesting
stuff. They're obviously being

597
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:46,080
on your podcast earlier. And
saying, you know, I think all of

598
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,200
these things where you have self
driving forklifts, for example,

599
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,830
a lot of this stuff, I mean,
I've and you know, coming into

600
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:56,280
the agriculture industry, for
example, I grew up in New

601
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:02,190
Zealand, and kind of very in a
rural region that does a lot of

602
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:06,120
fruit growing and picking, and I
had, you know, jobs in high

603
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:10,770
school where I was packing Kiwis
and boxes, and I've got all

604
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:14,790
sorts of things that don't
pruning. And I've done a number

605
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:17,010
of these tasks that kind of
happened on the agriculture

606
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,740
industry. And you know, I mean,
some of the tasks that you do, I

607
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,820
like, sit here and watch these
fruit roll by and grab the ones

608
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,190
that have blemishes and put them
on, you know, grate them into

609
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,130
like a BSE and grab the ones
that have blemishes and put them

610
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,600
onto this other conveyor belt.
And it's just not a sensible

611
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,210
task for a human to be doing in
this day and age. Right. And I

612
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,600
mean, maybe it was, you know, 15
years ago or something when I

613
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,380
was doing it, but like, you
know, computers with computer

614
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,170
vision and like manipulation on
some things can just do a much

615
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:49,200
better job of this now, they're
gonna be far more reliable, they

616
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,890
can do it at a higher pace. And
like, guess what, that wasn't a

617
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,640
fun job for anyone, I certainly
didn't enjoy it. Like, there's

618
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,090
much like more productive things
that as humans can be kind of

619
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:03,450
putting our time and energy
towards them, watching fruit

620
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:06,330
roll by and picking out the ones
that like, look strange.

621
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:12,180
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So, and one
other thing that kind of caught

622
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,260
my ear, was you saying, putting
1000 engineers towards the

623
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,150
problem? Can you just talk a bit
about that, that it's an

624
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:24,630
interesting idea to me. And it's
very different than, say, like a

625
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,060
startup thing, where you have
the 10 engineers that you were

626
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,060
mentioning, and building a
product? Or just a couple?

627
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:35,520
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, yeah, I
guess. I would look at it from a

628
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,620
perspective of what you know, in
1999, right. So you wanted to

629
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:44,280
start a startup in 1999. And
you're gonna build some web,

630
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,560
you're gonna build Amazon or
something, I guess they were a

631
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,410
little bit earlier. Okay, you're
gonna go to Amazon 97 or

632
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:53,190
something, okay. You're going
out and you're like, you know,

633
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,110
you need some people to write
code. But guess what, you also

634
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,210
need some people to go and buy
some servers and racks and

635
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,300
servers, you need, you know,
just like multiplies. You need

636
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,690
people doing all that,
especially as website starts

637
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,910
getting traction, you're
building everything from

638
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,180
scratch, right? You know, when
you say there's 1000 engineers

639
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,310
working on a problem, it's not
that they're all kind of in

640
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:15,060
they're super productive writing
the key kind of code day to day,

641
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,200
it's that you have to build kind
of all of the infrastructure of

642
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,390
the pyramid underneath you as
well, because there's nothing

643
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,930
Audrow Nash: because it doesn't
exist off the shelf. Whereas if

644
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:28,020
you're building PayPal or
something, or Amazon, you can

645
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,720
use react or some other
framework that does a lot of the

646
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,590
lifting for you.

647
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,200
Adrian Macneil: Right, if you're
doing this 20 years ago, you're

648
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,730
building Google or Facebook or
Amazon or Ebay or any of these

649
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,560
things you're building
everything from scratch, you're

650
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,350
not you know, you're not just
grabbing like a web framework

651
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:47,190
like react or Ruby on Rails even
know something you're kind of

652
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,520
you're writing all of the all of
the you know, went from scratch,

653
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,380
you're writing all of the
deployment from scratch, you're

654
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,140
buying hardware, you're racking
hardware, you're worrying about

655
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,900
like network connections, you're
making deals with ISP so that

656
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,710
you get enough bandwidth to
service like, it's crazy, man,

657
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,780
it sounds crazy, right? But
like, that's how one of these

658
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,790
companies got started. And
that's where we are in the

659
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:09,270
robotics industry today, right?
We're at this place where if you

660
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,730
want to build a, you know, build
a self driving car company, I

661
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:15,210
mean, 90% of the engineering
effort is not going to the core

662
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,620
kind of, you know, the core kind
of like algorithms and models

663
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,870
that are being developed on the
cards. That's all the stuff

664
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,630
around that everything that's
supporting and available off the

665
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:28,560
shelf today. Yeah. So you know,
if you if you talk that, you

666
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,540
know, one approaches kind of
brute force, which is like you

667
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,580
take those 1000 engineers and
say, Hey, you know, we're

668
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:36,990
pivoting to like self driving
forklifts now. Sure, like, maybe

669
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,470
it's an easier problem, and all
that talent could could get it

670
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:45,000
done. But I think, you know,
the, the more kind of scalable

671
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,070
approach over time is that
better and better quality

672
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:50,550
tooling comes out. And you know,
in the in the web industry, that

673
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,970
was AWS coming out, that was
Heroku coming out, that was

674
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:58,110
data, dog, and Splunk, and New
Relic and Sumo logic, and, you

675
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,410
know, all of these kind of
startups were founded in the

676
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:07,860
latter half of 2010, latter half
of the 2000s. where, you know,

677
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,670
by 2015, you want to go and set
a website up you just kind of

678
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:14,700
like slap a few things together,
and you know, two people or one

679
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,750
person and you have a company.
And, you know, I just I think

680
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,560
robotics needs to get there.
Obviously, it's, it's never

681
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,170
going to be as easy as building
a website and you have like

682
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,890
hardware and the real world to
deal with. But it could come a

683
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:31,710
long way from where it is today
in terms of like, having this

684
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,650
reusable components that you can
grab off the shelf glue together

685
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:35,670
and have a company

686
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:40,530
Audrow Nash: where so in all of
this building infrastructure, in

687
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,260
your mind, where does open
source?

688
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,500
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, that's a
really good question. Um, open

689
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,820
source is has you know, it's
both like, I guess very

690
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,730
important. It's contributed a
lot and, you know, we deeply

691
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:00,600
believe in open source. I think
the open source industry has

692
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,780
matured a lot over the last kind
of five or 10 years, especially

693
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:07,050
even the last five years, and
what business models work and

694
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:12,180
what business models don't. You
know, you've had some of these

695
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,660
things recently, like
Elasticsearch, MongoDB, a lot of

696
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,030
these companies have kind of
gone through a little bit of a

697
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,820
crisis where they said, Hey, you
know, we give everything away

698
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,720
for free. And then someone like
Amazon comes along and takes

699
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,970
that thing that you're giving
away for free and starts

700
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:30,030
reselling it, and they've kind
of like suck the air out of the

701
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:34,530
fact that you actually storing
it to pay employees. So I think,

702
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,130
you know, we've, we're an
advantage that, you know,

703
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:42,180
sitting here in 2021, is a lot,
a lot of evidence of what models

704
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,300
work in open source and more
models don't, I think, the fact

705
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,980
remains that open source is a
really good way to get products

706
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,320
out there and make them easy and
free for people to play with,

707
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,350
it's a really good way to build
a community around projects.

708
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,980
It's also frankly, a lot easier
to work with, you know, as a

709
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,000
consumer of open source. Even if
you're paying for support or

710
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,420
services around something, if
you if you get some you know,

711
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:09,660
you're working with a tool, as a
developer, you're working with a

712
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,030
tool, and then it's not quite
working for you, or you find a

713
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,540
bug or you need a feature, it's
so much easier if you can just

714
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,000
like look at the code and fix
the bug and build the feature.

715
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,600
Yeah, rather than stuck in this
like, yeah, you know, it's not

716
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,610
gonna it's like crazy, where
you've got to, like, go to their

717
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:27,180
support, and, you know, like,
turn into a ticket and goes to a

718
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,390
pm somewhere and they farm it
out to a team and you wait, like

719
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,250
two months when you could have
just changed a bit of code

720
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,810
yourself? Yeah. So you know,
yeah, open source is really

721
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:40,770
important. I think we strive to,
and we can talk a little bit

722
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:43,050
about, you know, well, how we're
thinking and where we're drawing

723
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:46,020
our mind. But I think it's
important to, you know, try and

724
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,720
open source as much as you can
and make that available to the

725
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,290
community and build a community
around it. But also, you know,

726
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,600
you need to be realistic about
the fact that you need to be

727
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,840
able to pay your employees and
you need to kind of fund the

728
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,540
development and the other things
that come around. And so it's

729
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:04,050
important to have kind of clear
delineation there, I guess.

730
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:09,030
Audrow Nash: Yeah. And so now,
natural segue. What's your

731
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,640
business model at cruise? How
are you kind of balancing open

732
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,620
source and paying your employees
and yeah,

733
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:14,370
Adrian Macneil: yeah, Fox?

734
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,900
Audrow Nash: Or Fox? Yes.

735
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,440
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, exactly. So we, yeah, I

736
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,370
mean, in keeping with that, I
think the the model, one open

737
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:26,250
source model? And actually, you
know, I think I was just

738
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:29,670
listening to your podcast with
Nick. And I think, I mean, I

739
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,550
probably share some similar
views on this, I think I don't

740
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,390
like the open source model,
where you kind of have an open

741
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,990
source version, and then you
have kind of a better version

742
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,360
that you have to pay for, which
is just, you know, more features

743
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,000
around it. I think that that
frustrates people want to, you

744
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,790
know, it kind of feels like
you're just kind of keeping the

745
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:51,330
crown jewels for yourself, I
think, you know, much better

746
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:55,290
models that we're seeing around
open source. There's, there's

747
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:59,250
kind of two related models that
work quite well. One is just

748
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,440
that you have an open source
product that people can run

749
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,280
themselves, and then you just
sell basically hosting of that,

750
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:10,230
of that thing. So you know,
that's where you see a lot of

751
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:14,160
companies kind of doing this
today. That's, you know, what,

752
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,150
like Elasticsearch and MongoDB.
And some of these people do, you

753
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:22,410
also see it with, like, next js,
and wsl, they kind of offer

754
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:26,100
like, a paid hosting. So that's
a front end framework, web

755
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,350
development framework and a web
hosting company, and they kind

756
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:31,920
of they sponsor the thing. So
that's one option, as you know,

757
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,350
kind of you build a thing, which
is completely free, and then you

758
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:38,070
have the hosting of it. The
other option, and you know,

759
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,080
where we're going as you build a
thing that's completely free,

760
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,140
you get all the features button,
this kind of add on services

761
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:47,040
that you know, you need if and I
guess more specifically, in our

762
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,700
case, we give you Foxconn
studio, it's free, it does

763
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,920
everything you want, you can run
it on your computer, you can run

764
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,970
it on the web browser, there's
no limitations. If you want our

765
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:59,970
services for collaboration, and
for kind of like team

766
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,400
communication, which we're
building around that, then those

767
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,290
are things that you need to log
in for, and those are

768
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:08,610
automatically going to be paid
features. So we actually, I

769
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:11,340
guess, you know, sort of pre
announcing this a little bit,

770
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,670
we'll be coming out with more
than a couple of weeks. But we

771
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:18,210
have some features in foxglove,
where today, you can kind of

772
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:21,720
have these layouts that you have
personally that live on your

773
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,940
computer, you can set up
different layouts that you might

774
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,090
use for different tasks when
you're debugging a particular

775
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:31,620
type of event. And we are coming
out very soon with a couple of

776
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,680
things. One is the ability to
kind of share these layouts

777
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,200
among team members. So being
able to actually like login,

778
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,380
starting to get into this world
of where we're sharing views

779
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,780
among among your team and making
it easier for people to

780
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,650
collaborate over robots data,
robotics data. And then the

781
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,560
other thing that we're building
which will be kind of, you know,

782
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,230
hosted service that you can work
with is actually that data

783
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:55,170
storage elements or, you know,
how can we be the central

784
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:58,380
repository if we get data so
that you know, as I said earlier

785
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,900
on so that you can just click on
a link can immediately start

786
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,110
looking at it without having to
go through that whole rigmarole

787
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,470
of downloading 100 gig bag for
your computer and sharing it to

788
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,740
your friend on a hard drive.
And, you know, running any of

789
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,290
these things locally, you can
just have a kind of central

790
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:16,140
repository for your data, click
on a link and immediately like

791
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,800
jump into it.

792
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:21,570
Audrow Nash: Now I'm struck by
so you were saying you and Dave

793
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:26,250
are sharing Dave Coleman from
move it or picnic are kind of

794
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,710
sharing a mind for these things.
I'm struck by you guys both

795
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:33,210
calling your service with
something studio. So your Fox

796
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,320
Studios movie studio, their new
release? Why did you pick the

797
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,900
name studio? What's the What's
there?

798
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,280
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, yeah. And
I mean, since creating foxglove

799
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,940
Studio, I think maybe it's just,
I've started seeing it

800
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,620
everywhere. I think, you know,
we're not the only two

801
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,520
companies. So far five other
companies with like, you know,

802
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,130
XYZ company name and then XYZ
studio and

803
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,750
Audrow Nash: this is the paid
version of whatever.

804
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:05,790
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, I mean, I
think it's it's, it's, it's

805
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:09,150
intended to be just, you know, a
product that you can jump into,

806
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,120
you know, you can you can see
what's happening, I guess we

807
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,440
wanted to separate that product
slightly from the company name,

808
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:19,800
because, you know, as I kind of
alluded to it, we're planning to

809
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:22,740
bring on some of these other
services and things. So we

810
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:26,070
needed something to
differentiate differentiate.

811
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,490
Yeah, exactly. This is our, our
kind of visualization tool that

812
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:32,910
you can see and open and
probably picnic, maybe a movie

813
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:38,250
felt the same way. Yeah. But
yeah, I guess, you know, and it

814
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,890
starts becoming a little bit of
a mouthful, if you have another

815
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,220
studio releases, like an AC word
that makes sense. But if you

816
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,950
come up with maybe, you know,
you already have a company name,

817
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:49,500
and then you forget something
else, rather long winded on the

818
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,290
end of the year, your product
name, you know, you get these

819
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:54,420
things like hashey, Corp
terraform. And you're like,

820
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:00,870
Audrow Nash: what is that? Yeah,
yeah. And speaking of What's in

821
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:03,720
a name, and although it's a bit
of a digression, I'd like to get

822
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,740
back to more of foxglove Studio,
but how did you come up with a

823
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:08,580
name? foxglove?

824
00:47:09,419 --> 00:47:13,469
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, yeah, this
is a question I get a few times.

825
00:47:14,459 --> 00:47:18,269
So I have, you know, my
philosophy on naming is that I

826
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:22,019
think that if I say the name to
you, you should be able to write

827
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:25,259
it down. And if I see it written
down, or if you see it written

828
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:29,069
down, you should know how to say
it. And I get kind of

829
00:47:29,069 --> 00:47:32,729
frustrated, but some of these
company names where, you know,

830
00:47:32,729 --> 00:47:35,789
they're either just like,
insane, not even company just

831
00:47:35,789 --> 00:47:38,219
project names. And then you have
like, Kubernetes, for example,

832
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:40,589
everyone goes around saying
Kubernetes like, it's an easy

833
00:47:40,589 --> 00:47:41,609
thing to say. Yeah.

834
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,950
Audrow Nash: It's like some
Starcraft thing or something.

835
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,400
All right.

836
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:48,810
Adrian Macneil: That's a Greek
god reference design. Yes. I

837
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:50,460
Audrow Nash: mean, it just
sounds like some futuristic

838
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,510
device. Yeah,

839
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,090
Adrian Macneil: yeah. Yeah,
that's sorry. And I have this

840
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,630
predisposition towards names
that are easy to say, and easy

841
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:01,050
to easy to spell and easy to
read. But of course, you know,

842
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:04,590
most of us are taken. So it's
been a long time with this kind

843
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,110
of short list of names that I
was going through. And I was

844
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:12,000
last year, just traveling around
New Zealand. And I was doing a

845
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,050
bit of a road trip with my wife
and child and this kind of

846
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:19,980
foxglove flowers are all over
the side of the road. Did the

847
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:28,050
song flower I have in the
background? So it was cool.

848
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:32,070
Yeah, just just a word. And I
thought that's a cool word. And

849
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,090
you know, it wasn't already
taken by a startup. So they have

850
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,890
no robotics reference. I'm
sorry.

851
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,710
Audrow Nash: I didn't know. I
just had no idea where it came

852
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:44,250
from. So it's a flower in the
hills of New Zealand somewhere.

853
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,670
Yeah, that sounds lovely. Yeah.
Okay. So if I understand

854
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:54,690
correctly, so foxglove Studio,
the. So you have all of

855
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:57,990
foxglove, where you can
visualize the data you see, and

856
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:03,360
it's for live playing of ROS 2
data and also playing from a bag

857
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:03,870
file

858
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:06,180
Adrian Macneil: playback.
Exactly. So you can connect to a

859
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,910
live system, or you can just
drag it back file and

860
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:11,760
immediately stop looking at that
bag file. You don't need ROS

861
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,430
installed or anything. If you
have a bag fine, you can just

862
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:14,880
open up.

863
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:18,360
Audrow Nash: And then the
studio. What are the kind of

864
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,210
killer features that you're
adding with this? So it's layout

865
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,970
support. So you can save a
layout, eventually, you can

866
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:27,660
share a layout. And it's data
storage coming soon.

867
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,960
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, these are
the these are the paid features

868
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,570
that we're building around it,
basically. So anything that

869
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:36,630
involves kind of collaborating
on your robotics data, where you

870
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:40,230
have multiple team members,
again, maybe you have a team of

871
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:42,510
five, or maybe you have a team
of 20, maybe you have a team of

872
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:45,750
100. But the larger your team
grows, the more important it is

873
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:49,800
that that you can collaborate
over that data. This is I think

874
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:53,520
people naturally understand this
because, you know, normally if

875
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,470
you have data stored in data dog
or Splunk, or Google Analytics,

876
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:02,100
the thing is, it's kind of sad.
In nature that you can just look

877
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,130
around a website and then copy a
link, if you if you want to send

878
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,140
something to your friend, you
just copy a link and paste in

879
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,080
slack and they can start looking
at it. And so, you know, this

880
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,870
kind of collaboration around
robotics data, I think is

881
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:15,900
something that that just doesn't
exist in the industry today, if

882
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:21,300
the kind of, you know, it's very
much a single focus on just, you

883
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,900
know, like, hair is my personal
workflow, I have some data on my

884
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,450
computer, or I have a bunch of
tools locally on my computer.

885
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,240
And if my friend wants to look
at it, then he's gonna, you

886
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,380
know, they're kind of out of
luck,

887
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,420
Audrow Nash: or you have to
write or read me up, and then

888
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,910
they can try to reproduce what
you do, right? Because the Yeah,

889
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,680
exactly 10 steps are more

890
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,760
Adrian Macneil: or less file,
you know, these topics kind of

891
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,510
that, you know, it's just, it's
a very, sort of add surface

892
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:46,110
process.

893
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:51,330
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Now, I want
to segue into talking about the

894
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:55,620
web and connecting it to
robotics, in some capacity.

895
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,320
Like, I'm very excited about
this, but would you speak on it?

896
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,430
Just playing Yeah. What do you
think the potential is there?

897
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:05,460
Why the web will be good. You
mentioned it a bit before, and

898
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,460
that there's a lot of people
that are knowledgeable of how to

899
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:13,740
do web programming. Yeah. But
anything else? Yeah,

900
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,900
Adrian Macneil: yeah, I think I
mean, this is something that a

901
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,350
lot of companies independently
coming to this conclusion, the

902
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:23,460
web is kind of the main platform
that anything that was built on

903
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,940
these days, and you know, that
can mean developer tools like

904
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:30,810
elsewhere, you're kind of diving
into specific instances. And

905
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:35,790
since of your robot, it can mean
kind of Fleet operations

906
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:39,600
tooling, we have companies like
forment.io, and freedom

907
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,420
robotics, and all that where you
know, you have a web based

908
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,780
interface where you can see you
know, your whole fleet of robots

909
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:50,820
and see what's going on with any
of them. It can also mean things

910
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:54,150
like tele operations and remote
assistance, where you need your

911
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:57,360
robot to kind of call out and
get human support and a human

912
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:02,040
eyes on things. It can even mean
you know, and web based labeling

913
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,370
tools, for example, where where
people are annotating data to

914
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:08,430
use for machine learning
training, those tools are again,

915
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,440
primarily web based. And it's
just because you have this

916
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,440
platform where you can build,
you know, visual interfaces, and

917
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:17,010
they're inherently plugged into
remote data stores, it's easy to

918
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,950
save, collaborate, it's kind of
you know, a similar transition

919
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:23,460
from having Microsoft Word
installed on your computer, to

920
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,560
Google Docs, right? And it's
just, you know, now you're

921
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,190
moving to something that is
inherently collaborative. And

922
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:32,430
so, you know, when we talk about
like the web and robots, I

923
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:36,540
think, we're not really
advocating that your robot is is

924
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,970
you know, written in JavaScript
or something like that, although

925
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:42,180
it's perfectly possible if you
want to go that route. But um,

926
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:45,720
but you know, the robot is the
robot, usually it's, it's, you

927
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,970
know, it's running ROS or
something similar. It's written

928
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:51,690
in Python or c++ or something
similar, but it needs to kind of

929
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:55,830
communicate with that outside
world. And so that means often

930
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:59,850
use web based technologies for
connecting from the robot to

931
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,700
services, for example, like
WebSockets are a really good way

932
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,330
if a robot communicating with a
server or browser communicating

933
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:10,830
with a server. You also have
technologies like web RTC, which

934
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:15,030
is a way for men, that's
probably how our video is

935
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:17,970
getting to each other right now,
it's kind of a way of streaming

936
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:21,960
videos and things like that
across the internet. So you have

937
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,540
a lot of these kind of web based
technologies, and they play

938
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,730
really well with robots, they're
really good for, you know,

939
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,440
communicating with fleets,
they're really good with

940
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:33,030
communicating, you know, even to
local devices. And it's really

941
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,670
good for building interfaces
where, you know, you don't have

942
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,800
to worry about which browser or
platform on things you're

943
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,010
running, you can just kind of,
you know, you can just open it

944
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,030
up, and it works.

945
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:48,270
Audrow Nash: And do you think,
can you talk a little bit more

946
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:52,320
about the benefit of making it
so that a lot of robotics

947
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:57,840
related things are made in a way
that like getting us a bigger

948
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:02,910
pool of programmers to work on
robotics problems through using

949
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,140
web technologies?

950
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:09,300
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, yeah, I
think, I mean, that is something

951
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,920
that we that always I found
interesting and Kurtis actually

952
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,230
was as we were hiring people,
candidates vastly underestimated

953
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:25,860
the need for robotics
experienced and work or self

954
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,830
driving experience to work on a
self driving car company. And

955
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:31,380
kind of, you know, am I talking
about the thing with the 1000

956
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:35,610
engineers and how, you know, 80%
of them are working on you know,

957
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:40,350
the the permit that kind of
supports the actual key

958
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:44,430
algorithm development. We needed
to hire a lot of people at

959
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:47,040
careers that were just experts
in infrastructure and data

960
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,090
processing and data management
and and, you know, web

961
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:52,950
development, front end
development JavaScript

962
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:56,940
engineers, and we didn't need
any of those people to have, you

963
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,550
know, a PhD in machine learning
or robotics or anything like

964
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:02,520
that. But there's kind of this
perception out there that like,

965
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,150
I'm not a robotics developer, I
can go and work at a self

966
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:10,500
driving car company. But, you
know, like I said, I think

967
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:14,580
there's this, there's, you know,
there's a large number of

968
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:17,190
candidates out, there are just,
you know, people AI engineers

969
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,140
out there that work for
companies doing all sorts of

970
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:22,500
stuff in the Silicon Valley
today. And around the world, and

971
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,170
a lot of that stuff is, you
know, much less meaningful,

972
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:27,540
there's a lot of people working
in AD tech and things like that,

973
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,450
that, you know, could be working
on our bonds, but maybe things

974
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,540
that you think that they can't,
so I would implore those people

975
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,660
to, you know, have a look at
some other really awesome stuff

976
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:41,820
that is happening out there. And
realize that one of the most

977
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:45,330
exciting things to me about
robotics is just how diverse of

978
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:47,610
a space it is, how many
different skill sets you need,

979
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:50,370
and you know, you can come into
it, and maybe you're experienced

980
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:52,140
in front end development, or
maybe you're experienced in

981
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,890
DevOps. And you'll sit down with
people who, you know, like I

982
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:58,410
said, machine learning PhDs or
something, but you sit down with

983
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:00,990
people who are physicists, and
people who are working on, you

984
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,900
know, hardware, and you sit down
with electrical engineers, and

985
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:08,370
all of these people need to kind
of come together and, you know,

986
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:11,280
it's, it's, it's really
important to bring all of those

987
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,690
skill sets together, and
robotics and I think, yeah, I

988
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,610
don't know, I think there's
like, a gigantic, huge

989
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:23,970
opportunity there as more of the
maybe for a look for for a long

990
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:27,780
time, robotics is kind of being
a little bit off in a corner.

991
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:32,130
You know, a lot of the industry
has been building, you know, ad

992
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:35,130
tech, and, you know, consumer
startups and even enterprise

993
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:38,430
startups and a lot of stuff for
processing enterprise data and a

994
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:43,380
lot of things for for, you know,
social media and social

995
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:46,650
networking and things. But
robotics is kind of spent a long

996
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:49,890
time and a slightly academic
corner of the world, I guess,

997
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,760
you know, people have been
working on robots, for, you

998
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,280
know, decades to this point. And
certainly the last 15 years,

999
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,560
there's been a lot of really
interesting stuff happening. But

1000
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:04,170
you know, it hasn't had as much
kind of attention, I guess, as

1001
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,650
like the as the wider startup
industry. And I think we're kind

1002
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:09,720
of reaching a tipping point now
and more and more engineers

1003
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:13,710
coming over who have experienced
and maybe more traditional

1004
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:15,840
software development, maybe they
don't understand the robotics

1005
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,870
spaces, but they can, you know,
they can sit down on paper with

1006
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:21,000
the people who really
understand, you know, control

1007
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,500
theory or, or machine learning
or planning or things like this,

1008
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,940
and you put that together, you
get some really high quality

1009
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:30,480
software.

1010
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,700
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Very
interesting perspective. Do you

1011
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,600
think that web technologies, so
we're speaking about often web

1012
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,880
technologies kind of on the
front end, so mostly for

1013
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,240
visualization or connecting to
other things? Yeah. Do you think

1014
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:49,170
it will ever? Or are there
benefits to doing web

1015
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:52,950
technology? So like, from the
back end? So using things like

1016
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:55,680
node j. s, or Dino or something
like that?

1017
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:58,290
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, I think I
mean, there's kind of a tourism

1018
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:01,620
that like, everything that can
be written in JavaScript will be

1019
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:07,320
written in JavaScript at some
point. There's people out there

1020
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:12,300
writing robots in JavaScript and
and, you know, even the

1021
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,720
JavaScript ecosystem, that's not
what it was 10 or even five

1022
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,030
years ago, right? It's, it's
continually moving. And a lot of

1023
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,460
these things like TypeScript
have come out, which provide a

1024
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,870
lot more structure around.

1025
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,340
Audrow Nash: I really like
TypeScript type projects I've

1026
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,620
done it seems like Yeah,
exactly.

1027
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:31,020
Adrian Macneil: It's Yeah, it's
really nice. These these things

1028
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:36,060
are coming out. So you know, for
sure, I think people will use

1029
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:42,060
languages like JavaScript and j.
s, and, and things on robots.

1030
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,700
But, you know, equally you're
seeing people branch out into

1031
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,210
like, using rust for robots, for
example. And, you know, that

1032
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:51,420
would arguably be a benefit for
a lot of these kinds of embedded

1033
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:54,540
applications where you're, you
know, you're pretty resource

1034
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:58,620
constrained, you have to deal
with, you know, even I mean,

1035
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:01,440
even when you have like, a very
large computer available to you,

1036
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,260
you're always worrying about you
know, energy consumption,

1037
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,750
battery life and, you know,
competing things that are trying

1038
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:12,390
to run moment. So say, I think,
you know, rust and go Broly or

1039
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:15,870
both, yeah, potentially,
potentially quite interesting.

1040
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:20,580
Things that might end up, you
know, picking up a bit of steam

1041
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:24,960
on robots, but I wouldn't, I
wouldn't say that they that, you

1042
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,370
know, JavaScript or web Tech has
an inherent advantage. for

1043
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:32,580
writing kind of the robot code
itself, I would say most of the

1044
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:35,400
benefit, there are things around
how you're communicating with

1045
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,920
back end services, how your
voting UI would be able to

1046
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,280
interact with their robots.
Things like ROS bridge, for

1047
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,260
example, is a that's a WebSocket
protocol, where you can connect

1048
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:50,070
from a ROS system to a web
browser or from a raw system to

1049
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:53,880
a server to a web browser. We
you know, our team has been

1050
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,580
contributing a bunch to ROS
bridge project lately and

1051
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:00,300
getting that up and running with
ROS two, which has been You

1052
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,690
know, really great for the
community. And you know, these

1053
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:06,900
are these are really where the
web stack plugs in, and the

1054
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,020
protocols that we're using to
communicate with robots, and

1055
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:13,560
that kind of interfaces where we
can interact with robots.

1056
01:00:15,389 --> 01:00:18,149
Audrow Nash: Now I'd like to
talk about you for a little bit.

1057
01:00:19,979 --> 01:00:25,109
So you were at Coinbase, as one
of the early employees, then you

1058
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:29,369
were an early employee at
cruise. And now you're starting

1059
01:00:29,369 --> 01:00:35,789
foxglove. The earliest? The
earliest? Yeah. So to me, it's

1060
01:00:35,789 --> 01:00:39,089
kind of I see it as you're
jumping into things when they're

1061
01:00:39,089 --> 01:00:44,039
very interesting. So you jumped
into cryptocurrency, you were

1062
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:47,789
you seem like you were very
early into that, being at

1063
01:00:47,789 --> 01:00:52,979
Coinbase, when they were pretty
young, then self driving cars.

1064
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:57,119
And it basically took off, there
was so much interest around it.

1065
01:00:57,629 --> 01:01:01,649
And crews went from 20 to, I
don't know, 2000 employees, or

1066
01:01:01,649 --> 01:01:05,459
whatever you said, Can you just
tell me a bit about your

1067
01:01:05,459 --> 01:01:10,679
thinking around these things?
Your experience? I don't know.

1068
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,550
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, yeah, for
sure. I, I do really enjoy, I

1069
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:20,850
guess, futuristic technologies.
And, you know, thinking about

1070
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:24,060
the future. Some people maybe,
you know, take this a little too

1071
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:27,180
far and think about things that
are, you know, really far out.

1072
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:31,290
And if it's going to take 50
years, then, you know, maybe

1073
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:33,210
it's not the best thing to
invest your time in today. Or

1074
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:36,930
maybe it's something to do, but
I really like thinking about

1075
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:40,230
those kind of, you know, 10 or
20 year horizon, and you know,

1076
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:44,730
what direction is the world
going. And you know, that I

1077
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:47,790
actually in my early in my
career, I did a lot of things

1078
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:51,330
with payments and e commerce,
actually wrote an entire like e

1079
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:54,450
commerce framework and a bunch
of payment gateway integrations.

1080
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:58,860
And that led me to sort of
interest in Bitcoin, I guess,

1081
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:02,220
pretty early on, I saw, you
know, I just started looking at

1082
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:05,220
Bitcoin, I initially thought it
was a scam. But then I started

1083
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,890
getting interested in this idea
of kind of, you know, cross

1084
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:12,240
border payments and
permissionless money. And I

1085
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:16,080
thought, there's a real
opportunity for this to become

1086
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,260
something that is a lot bigger
than it is today. And it's

1087
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:23,790
something that people use in
their day to day lives. I would

1088
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:27,270
say with the Bitcoin space, in
particular, though, there's a

1089
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:30,150
lot of, there's a lot of people
and you know, even in the early

1090
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:32,190
days, there were a lot of people
who were in it for the

1091
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:35,370
technology, I guess, who were
kind of, you know, excited about

1092
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:38,400
in the future could bring in,
you know, even the kind of

1093
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,280
technical developments that
happened there. But because it

1094
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,670
was kind of also a financial
instrument, there were a lot of

1095
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:49,380
people who were just in it for
the money. And that led to quite

1096
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:53,310
a sort of hostile community. And
I actually think maybe kryptos,

1097
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:56,910
as turned a bit of a corner, now
you get a lot of these kind of

1098
01:02:56,910 --> 01:03:00,360
things coming out, like NF T's
where people are clearly just

1099
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,240
having fun with it, and not, you
know, not stressing so much

1100
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,100
about whether they're going to
be millionaires or anything.

1101
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:10,740
Maybe they still are, but but
the crypto community, I mean,

1102
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:13,080
there was a lot of, especially
in the early days, there's a lot

1103
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:17,400
of infighting in the community
around block sizes. And it got,

1104
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:22,140
you know, it got a little
frustrating to me that yeah, it

1105
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:23,040
was it was

1106
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:27,750
Audrow Nash: a lot because it
could be interesting, the

1107
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:31,110
technology and the implications
of it, but people are like

1108
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:34,560
infighting trying to get a
little more influence or a

1109
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,690
little better for themselves or
something

1110
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:38,699
Adrian Macneil: kind of
attractive, you know, if you

1111
01:03:38,699 --> 01:03:41,399
have any, you know, different
people for different reasons.

1112
01:03:41,399 --> 01:03:44,039
Some people like to technology,
some people just want to get

1113
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:46,259
rich, some people were in that
because they think like, oh,

1114
01:03:46,259 --> 01:03:48,629
taxation is theft, and then the
government should be abolished

1115
01:03:48,629 --> 01:03:50,969
or something. And so you have
this, like, kind of strange

1116
01:03:50,969 --> 01:03:54,329
melting pot of like, and then
Coinbase was right in the middle

1117
01:03:54,329 --> 01:03:56,729
of that trying to sell Bitcoin
to people who thought that, you

1118
01:03:56,729 --> 01:04:00,269
know, all tax was theft, but yet
had to like appease banking

1119
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:04,259
regulators, or, or, you know,
her, like very much thought that

1120
01:04:04,259 --> 01:04:07,589
they needed, you know, legally
very much did have to understand

1121
01:04:07,589 --> 01:04:09,599
absolutely everything that's
happening about every

1122
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:12,479
transaction on the platform. So,
you know, that was an

1123
01:04:12,479 --> 01:04:16,979
experience. But I, I kind of,
you know, as I said, my co

1124
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:20,399
founder, sort of introduced me
to currency when he was at

1125
01:04:20,399 --> 01:04:27,089
Coinbase. And then he went to
cruise. And I, you know, I, I

1126
01:04:27,089 --> 01:04:29,789
guess I went through the
experience that I was just

1127
01:04:29,789 --> 01:04:32,969
describing earlier of being an
engineer, not from my robotics

1128
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:37,799
background, but kind of coming
into this company. I really, my

1129
01:04:37,799 --> 01:04:39,959
eyes were opened up to both like
opportunities that were

1130
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:42,539
possible, but also that it was
very obvious that I could

1131
01:04:42,539 --> 01:04:45,389
actually contribute a lot,
despite not having that robotics

1132
01:04:45,389 --> 01:04:48,179
experience. Because, you know, I
found that a lot of the robotics

1133
01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:50,819
engineers didn't have the
experience I had, it's just you

1134
01:04:50,819 --> 01:04:52,679
know, like I say, you have all
of these people from different

1135
01:04:52,679 --> 01:04:55,229
backgrounds come together and
you need that in robotics, you

1136
01:04:55,229 --> 01:04:57,719
need that, you know, the
hardware engineers, mechanical,

1137
01:04:57,719 --> 01:05:00,659
electrical engineers, you need
the you know, Now, folks, you

1138
01:05:00,659 --> 01:05:03,299
need the planning controls,
folks. You need the back end

1139
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:06,269
infrastructure, you need the
kind of UI and visualization.

1140
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:10,679
And, you know, it was it was
kind of obvious that this was

1141
01:05:10,679 --> 01:05:14,879
about something that, you know,
was was also going to be a, you

1142
01:05:14,879 --> 01:05:19,649
know, big interesting trend. But
But, you know, I just felt that

1143
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,779
there was a lot more focus on
kind of substance, I guess,

1144
01:05:21,779 --> 01:05:26,099
compared to the crypto space
where Yeah, yeah, a little bit,

1145
01:05:26,129 --> 01:05:29,249
a little bit too much hype. So
that that kind of, you know, led

1146
01:05:29,249 --> 01:05:32,339
to my interest there. And I
think Cruz really opened my eyes

1147
01:05:32,339 --> 01:05:35,339
to, you know, what was possible
in the space, like I said, I

1148
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:38,039
think it's, you know, it's
really clear that the robotics

1149
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:41,699
industry has been making a ton
of progress over the years, it's

1150
01:05:41,699 --> 01:05:45,089
clear that a lot of these
problems that people have

1151
01:05:45,089 --> 01:05:48,029
struggled with, you know, actual
technical problems and robotics

1152
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:51,899
that people are struggling with.
Within Reach now, they're, you

1153
01:05:51,899 --> 01:05:55,019
know, they're solvable, given
enough time and resources. And

1154
01:05:55,229 --> 01:05:57,869
given better tools, the time and
resource kind of needs are going

1155
01:05:57,869 --> 01:06:01,919
to come down. So yeah, that,
like I said, they're kind of

1156
01:06:01,919 --> 01:06:04,769
just continues the trajectory of
our stuff where I think we can

1157
01:06:04,859 --> 01:06:07,739
not just help us, you know, not
just have one self driving car

1158
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:11,189
company get off the road. But
you know, you look around, you

1159
01:06:11,189 --> 01:06:13,559
see, all of the self driving car
companies are building the same

1160
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:17,369
tools, and you say, Hey, hey,
there's an opportunity here to

1161
01:06:17,369 --> 01:06:20,489
kind of like reduce duplication,
reduce kind of people,

1162
01:06:20,819 --> 01:06:24,029
reinventing wheels, but also, we
can look at all these other

1163
01:06:24,029 --> 01:06:26,669
robotics companies that don't
have anywhere near that level of

1164
01:06:26,669 --> 01:06:29,849
resources. And they all need it,
too. So you know, this

1165
01:06:29,849 --> 01:06:32,519
opportunity is here for us to
make everyone's life easier.

1166
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:36,870
Audrow Nash: Mm hmm. That's
great. I'd be remiss if I didn't

1167
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:41,220
ask, what do you think the
timeline is for autonomous cars?

1168
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,150
Adrian Macneil: That is a that's
the money question.

1169
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,990
Audrow Nash: I mean, even like,
started, I like next couple

1170
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:51,450
years, next 10s of years. Yeah,

1171
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,930
Adrian Macneil: yeah. I mean,
they're here. Right? So it's a

1172
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:58,350
question of walking on Congress,
what cannot autonomous cars

1173
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:02,520
achieve? Yeah, autonomous level
for autonomous cars here, when I

1174
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:07,140
was, as you know, have cars
running in Arizona today, fully

1175
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:11,400
autonomous, that, you know, the
general public can can, can, I

1176
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,380
mean, maybe it's a limited
number of people, maybe it's a

1177
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:18,390
limited kind of sun. But maybe I
should back up a bit for the For

1178
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:22,230
those unfamiliar with those
unfamiliar with the like levels

1179
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:27,120
of autonomy. Basically, you go
from kind of a scale where level

1180
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:30,090
one, I'm not even sure what
level one is level two is, is

1181
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:34,320
the car can kind of like, do
basic things. So this is kind of

1182
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,560
like a Tesla autopilot where it
can, you know, the car can steer

1183
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:40,470
in a lane and the car can can
brake and accelerate for you.

1184
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,610
But ultimately, you're at level
two, you're still completely

1185
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:47,460
responsible for anything that
God does. So if the car crashes,

1186
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:51,060
you can't kind of blame it on
the car. Level Three is

1187
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:56,010
basically that in some
situations, the car can be fully

1188
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:59,580
responsible, but it may need to
wake you up. So like, you can go

1189
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:01,860
to sleep, maybe it'll put you on
the freeway, and maybe it'll do

1190
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:05,250
the bulk of the driving. But
you're going to get like a 32nd

1191
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:07,320
warning or something saying
like, hey, by the way, you know,

1192
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,060
it's time to wake up because I
don't know what I'm doing, I

1193
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:12,450
need help. But you know, there's
some kind of like, there's some

1194
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:15,360
kind of kind of warning element,
whereas level two, it's like, I

1195
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:18,630
don't know, the cop might just
do something crazy. And then the

1196
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:22,290
definition of level four is that
within a defined kind of

1197
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:25,920
operating domain, the car can be
fully responsible. And so

1198
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:31,140
that's, you know, we see that
companies doing Robo taxis. You

1199
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,630
know, the cars are fully
responsible, and that you jump

1200
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:36,060
in the taxi, it takes you from A
to B and you jump out and you're

1201
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:39,660
done. There's a geo fence around
it, you can't, you know, jump on

1202
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:42,570
it and expect you to drive it to
the next day, or in some cases

1203
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:45,480
of counting when you drive on
the freeway, but within the

1204
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,750
domain that was designed for the
car was completely responsible.

1205
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:55,680
Audrow Nash: Not this not not
some level of highway or some

1206
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,810
products, like a restriction on
where I

1207
01:08:57,809 --> 01:09:00,059
Adrian Macneil: can go domain
could be restricted to certain

1208
01:09:00,059 --> 01:09:03,149
roads, it could be restricted to
a certain time of day like

1209
01:09:03,149 --> 01:09:03,419
night.

1210
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,120
Audrow Nash: And weather
conditions or weather

1211
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:06,720
conditions.

1212
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,280
Adrian Macneil: Yeah, if there's
heavy rain, they're going to

1213
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:11,790
pull them off the road. But in
the domain, and the operating

1214
01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:14,520
domain that it was designed for
the car is fully responsible.

1215
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:19,050
And so that that is happening
today. Right. And that, you

1216
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:23,220
know, that is, I think it's
gonna be something it'll be over

1217
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:26,280
the next 10 years, you know,
it's just going to increase more

1218
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,640
and more domains where you can
see it. More and more, you know,

1219
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,270
companies are going to be the
flying cars out there. More

1220
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,340
domains are opening up,
certainly, I think we'll see

1221
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:39,450
this happening, you know, in San
Francisco very soon, probably on

1222
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:44,160
the order of like, next year or
the year after really, after

1223
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:48,960
that, but I think that and
again, and certain domains,

1224
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,000
right, maybe if it starts
raining, which doesn't really

1225
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,700
happen very often in San
Francisco, but maybe maybe if

1226
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,250
that does, then the cars aren't
going to be running. I don't

1227
01:09:56,250 --> 01:10:00,480
know. But I think you know,
they're like us. They're already

1228
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,850
doing this in Arizona, and I
think it's only a matter of time

1229
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:06,180
for you to start seeing it in
denser cities. And then it just

1230
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:08,850
evolved from there at the kind
of domain expands. And

1231
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:11,460
eventually the cars have better
sensors and more processing

1232
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:16,410
power and can go faster and more
safely. And so that that I think

1233
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:18,630
is just gonna be, you know,
very, like, smoother than

1234
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:23,790
iterative. But the, you know,
level five, I think is, is kind

1235
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:28,020
of, in my opinion, not even
really worth defining level five

1236
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:30,900
is kind of defined as like, the
car can do everything a human

1237
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:36,660
can do. And, in my mind, I'm not
clear on why you would really

1238
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:40,890
want a car to do that, I guess
like, there's this, there's

1239
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:44,790
expanding level four to like,
Hey, I can drive on the road and

1240
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:48,840
on the wall, right? But like
everything is human, I mean, a

1241
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,500
human can drive like a four hour
drive through a burning forest,

1242
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:57,060
avoiding flames and like, like
humans, can humans are very

1243
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:59,850
adaptive in the right situation,
right. And I like I don't, I

1244
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:03,180
don't know that I ever see a
world where a car is going to be

1245
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:07,020
able to do literally everything
a human can do. But it doesn't

1246
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:08,730
matter, right, you're going to
get to a point where a car can

1247
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:10,920
drive you, you know, from one
side of the country to the other

1248
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:14,460
without stopping and without you
without even having a steering

1249
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,590
wheel, then, you know, it
doesn't really matter that it

1250
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:18,630
kind of drives through a burning
forest or something.

1251
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:24,240
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Gotcha. Well,
that's awesome. It's so

1252
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:28,110
interesting that it's so close.
I look forward to, I hope in

1253
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:30,900
like a year or two, I'm able to
take a ride in San Francisco.

1254
01:11:30,929 --> 01:11:33,179
Adrian Macneil: I mean, these
things start slowly, right? It's

1255
01:11:33,179 --> 01:11:36,269
like, you know, Uber existed in
2010. But no one was using it

1256
01:11:36,269 --> 01:11:39,719
until until later. You know,
they're coming in, they're

1257
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:41,969
onboard people, and they have to
ramp up their operations, and

1258
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:45,239
they have to improve, you know,
this, this. I mean, you know,

1259
01:11:45,269 --> 01:11:47,669
every year the cost get better,
are they able to handle more

1260
01:11:47,669 --> 01:11:49,979
situations, they're more
assertive, they're more human

1261
01:11:49,979 --> 01:11:54,629
like, and they're driving. It's,
it's, it's only a matter of time

1262
01:11:54,629 --> 01:11:57,779
until the areas that they can
operate effectively, kind of

1263
01:11:57,779 --> 01:12:00,659
increases. But you know, you
might have to get on a waiting

1264
01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:01,349
list or something.

1265
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:07,560
Audrow Nash: Yep. Let's see. And
so starting to wrap up, what

1266
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,920
what advice do you have for
someone that's just starting

1267
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,310
their career or think like
really early, like a 20 year old

1268
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:19,080
you? What would that advice end
for now? Yeah, what advice would

1269
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:19,560
you have?

1270
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:24,480
Adrian Macneil: I think, um, you
know, robotics is a big space

1271
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:29,700
and figure out which pieces that
you're interested in and you

1272
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:32,220
know, a couple of things one
maybe don't get too bogged down

1273
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:34,800
and thinking that you need to
like specifically work on ml or

1274
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,230
something or, you know, you can
be an electrical engineer

1275
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:42,090
working on robotics or you know,
things like that. Yeah, there

1276
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:46,110
you go. So don't don't roll that
out. Right, there's a lot of

1277
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:50,100
this is robotics industry is
very diverse in terms of skill

1278
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:53,640
sets. And it takes all of those
different skill sets to come

1279
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,850
together. It's not just, you
know, a bunch of ml engineers

1280
01:12:56,850 --> 01:13:01,530
or, or, you know, robotics,
engineers writing c++. And so I

1281
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:06,600
think, you know, don't
certainly, like take classes or

1282
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,730
try and get internships at
different companies and work on

1283
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:12,570
different things. But, you know,
don't get hung up on this

1284
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:15,780
feeling that you need, you know,
one specific kind of skill set

1285
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:18,030
and to get into robotics, I
think, you know, everyone can

1286
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:20,940
get into robotics if you're, if
you're sufficiently interested.

1287
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:27,450
And then the other thing is just
I think generally, people early

1288
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:31,020
in their career vastly
underestimate how valuable it

1289
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:34,920
can be to build probably
projects where you control end

1290
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:39,030
to end and you know, this is not
like I'm not saying like, you

1291
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:41,730
know, go and do work in the
spare time or something but if

1292
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:44,970
you want to understand how
robots work on their own, don't

1293
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:48,420
get me you can get a kit for
under $100 off Amazon to build a

1294
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:50,940
self driving car with just you
know, some little some little

1295
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:53,880
motors and a little camera and a
Raspberry Pi camera on things

1296
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:58,140
but build the intervention thing
right i mean there's you know,

1297
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:00,330
there's stuff out there even
like Ducky town which is great

1298
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:04,410
but even that is coming to you
with a lot of pieces already

1299
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:07,830
kind of already thought out and
if you foster this kind of like

1300
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:10,590
boat a little hobby project
where you you know, even just

1301
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:14,250
get like a Raspberry Pi and so
you know, Python on figuring out

1302
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:17,250
how to control the little servos
from your, from your command

1303
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:20,430
line. You know, you don't even
have to have any like sensing or

1304
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:23,910
thinking or acting happening
just figure out how to like get

1305
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:28,140
me in a command line happening
wired up 30 of Python and make

1306
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:30,450
the wheel spin you know, that'll
teach you a lot about how the

1307
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:32,910
internet piece works. And when
you go into a you know, a

1308
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:37,830
company Sure, it's not gonna be
like directly applicable but you

1309
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:41,610
understand how the kind of you
know how the pieces fit them. I

1310
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:45,180
think you know, that, that
engineers that I've worked with

1311
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:49,740
that, that can kind of go from
like the very big to the very

1312
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:52,530
small and back again, the best
in the industry, the ones that

1313
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,350
are not just thinking about, you
know, what is this little

1314
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:58,230
component that I'm working on,
but how does it fit into the

1315
01:14:58,230 --> 01:15:01,560
bigger picture and obviously,
edit the account. We know one

1316
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:05,130
human can understand the big
picture. So doing that on a much

1317
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:08,430
smaller scale is just really
important to understand, you

1318
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:10,590
know, like what all of those
components actually look like.

1319
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:18,090
Audrow Nash: So now, how can
people reach out? or How can

1320
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:22,020
they contribute to the foxglove?
any links or anything you'd like

1321
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:22,560
to share?

1322
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,830
Adrian Macneil: Definitely,
yeah, we love contributions, we

1323
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:29,100
love people reaching out, you
know, we have, so you can go to

1324
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:33,090
Fox club dot Dev, that's our
website, you can download Fox

1325
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:36,450
doc studio, you can open it in
the browser, try it out and give

1326
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:39,570
us feedback. We have links on
there to our community channels,

1327
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:45,120
GitHub, Slack, things like that.
You know, if you find that

1328
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,300
useful, great, tell us, we'd
love feedback, feel free to make

1329
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:52,770
contributions for requests,
report issues, those are all

1330
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:56,670
helpful. Also, you know, if this
is something that's interesting

1331
01:15:56,670 --> 01:15:59,340
to you, if there's something you
want to work on, just feel free

1332
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:04,800
to contact me or us directly.
And if it's something that that

1333
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:08,190
you're working on at a company
and feel like you struggling

1334
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:10,740
with these kind of tools around
how you're collaborating over

1335
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:14,220
robotics data, you know, also
reach out we'd love to chat

1336
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:17,160
about it, even if that's kind of
getting you access to our beta

1337
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:21,060
or, or, you know, just talking
about more about where we're

1338
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:24,210
going. We were an early stage
company. We love getting

1339
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:27,030
feedback from people and just
engaging with the community. So

1340
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:32,220
Audrow Nash: all right, awesome.
Thank you. Awesome, thanks.

1341
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:37,740
That's all we have for you
today. I was surprised by

1342
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:40,830
Adrian's answer to what he
thinks for the timeline of

1343
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:44,490
autonomous cars. What do you
think? Let us know in the

1344
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:48,810
comments on sensing act.com
thank you again to our founding

1345
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:51,360
sponsor Open Robotics. Goodbye,
everyone.
