00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,010
Audrow Nash: Hi, everyone,
welcome to the Sense Think Act

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,180
Podcast. I'm the host Audrow
Nash. And in today's episode I

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,590
interview Ryan Gariepy, Chief
Technology Officer of Clearpath

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,340
robotics. Clearpath robotics
makes several mobile robotics

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,390
platforms that are used by
researchers and corporations. We

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,410
talk about the origin of
Clearpath robotics, how they

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,720
have focused on making extremely
robust robots, how Clearpath

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,890
uses ROS 1 and ROS 2, and on the
future of robotics, I thought it

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,830
was very interesting to see how
clear path as a company has

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,600
matured with expectations and
the robotics industry. And I

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,860
really enjoyed hearing what Ryan
thinks will be the future of

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,540
robotics in the next two to five
years. As always, big thank you

13
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,840
to our founding sponsor, Open
Robotics, and I hope you enjoy

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,530
the episode.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,650
So to start, I would love to
have you just introduce yourself

16
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,290
and tell us a bit about
ClearPath, too.

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,090
Ryan Gariepy: Of course, the My
name is Ryan Gariepy. I'm the

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,530
CTO and co founder of Clearpath
robotics. And I have been stuck

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,290
in my office for about a year
and a half and counting.

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,590
Audrow Nash: All right, and so
tell me a bit more about

21
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,820
Clearpath. What's the kind of
mission that you guys are going

22
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,880
for? And how long has the
company been around?

23
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,940
Clearpath has been around for
just over 12 years, probably 12

24
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:45,420
years, 12 years, one month and
21 days, I believe, as of today.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,980
Twenty one days!

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,550
Something like that, the we
started, we started as the

27
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,260
company with an intent to be the
company to go to when you had a

28
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,330
robotics problem, and you didn't
know where to go to solve it, or

29
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,010
you had ideas on a problem that
you thought you could solve with

30
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,110
robots, but you weren't quite
sure you weren't, you didn't

31
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,310
know where to go. And it wasn't
necessarily a consultancy, it

32
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,010
was about building some of these
products, these baseline

33
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,590
products and hardware and
software because it didn't exist

34
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,780
at the time. And that's
certainly been the case, we have

35
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,890
seen the robotics market grow
beyond our wildest dreams. And

36
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,030
six years ago, we also started a
sister company called auto

37
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,010
motors, which is a more
vertically integrated supplier

38
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,820
of production grade autonomous
materials, but autonomous mobile

39
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,760
robots to the materials handling
industry. And that's also been

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,090
exciting. we've, we've actually
driven, you know, millions and

41
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,720
millions of hours unsupervised,
fully autonomous on that side of

42
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,410
the business, which I'm sure for
all of the roboticists listening

43
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,740
out there, they they appreciate
the challenges inherent in that.

44
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,210
Okay, so you started ClearPath
wanting it to be for solving

45
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,430
general robotics problems. How
do you do approach like that?

46
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,440
How did you approach making it
so you could solve general

47
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,490
robotics problems?

48
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,580
Well, when we were started, or
when we, when we got started,

49
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,040
there was no standard way to
build a robot or no standard way

50
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,490
to build software, anyone doing
research, whether it's

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,510
theoretical, very academic
research, or applications level

52
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,140
Industrial Research, or
government research, you were

53
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,230
always building everything from
scratch, the hardware,

54
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,490
obviously, but also all of the
software, right there, there was

55
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,520
open source robotic software,
but it wasn't really well used.

56
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,020
And we want it to be that
company, where you could go to

57
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,050
and describe your problem,
whether it's the research, the

58
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,900
research problems, or the
application you were trying to

59
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,280
investigate. And that we would
help you move forward without

60
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,760
having to build your own
expertise in robotics from the

61
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,060
ground up, before you even
started. You want, you know,

62
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,840
researchers want to research or
entrepreneurs want to want to

63
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,170
test ideas. They don't want to
be, you know, they don't want to

64
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,510
be caught up in a year of
learning how to build a robot

65
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,450
before they even get started on
what their idea is. It's

66
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,630
demoralizing and frustrating.
Hmm.

67
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,360
And so Clearpath you guys have a
bunch of general platforms

68
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,120
effectively that people can
build off of for their different

69
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,420
applications, like on different
surfaces and things.

70
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah, we started we started in
the OCR space. And that was

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,180
because we'd realized and this
this was back in 2008 2009. We

72
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:54,180
realized that outdoors was where
the really valuable use cases

73
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,350
were going to start appearing.
Were the new valuable use cases

74
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,660
we're going to start appearing
at least That's where the

75
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,910
research was being done. And on
top of that, on top of that, the

76
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,160
on top of that, there was a lot
of recent progress around things

77
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,250
like sensors. For example, when
I started my undergraduate

78
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:21,240
degree it cost probably $3,000
to buy a an IMU, which was,

79
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,400
which was half decent, which
could tell you basically which

80
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,520
way was up. And then through the
end of my, under the end of my

81
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,930
undergraduate, it was, you know,
30 bucks. Now wide, ours were

82
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,330
still blindingly expensive at
the time, but we were starting

83
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,460
to see those prices drop we, for
example, the the U r, g o four,

84
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,570
which was the first really
affordable navigation grade

85
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,990
LIDAR, you know, small one about
that big that that appeared

86
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,240
through the end of my, if I
recall, correctly through the,

87
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,370
through the end of my
undergraduate time. So we're

88
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,840
starting to see this significant
drop in sensors as well as a

89
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,950
significant increase in the
power capabilities of the

90
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,550
robots. So now off road was all
of a sudden possible, and it was

91
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,320
this brand new space and
research

92
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,520
just for scale. How much do you
think you could get a comparable

93
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,100
IMU or Inertial Measurement
Unit? For today? Like the same

94
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,220
quality? Would it be like, my
guess would be like 10 bucks or

95
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,750
something? Or what do you think
it would be?

96
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,020
On the volume Far, far, far
cheaper, for cheaper, the the

97
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,230
most expensive part these days
would be the engineering effort

98
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,850
to stick it on the PCB. That's
crazy, like between the IMU

99
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,700
between the IMU themselves and
all of the filtering software

100
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,710
that now exists, and the
processing software that now

101
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,070
exists, like, your cell phone is
probably better than those first

102
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,240
time use we were using.

103
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, that's absolutely crazy.
And then so outdoor, how did you

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,230
identify that most? Or that
there was a lot of potential

105
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:54,660
interesting things for outdoor
robotics applications? Like what

106
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,200
were you looking at?

107
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,120
Yeah, if we start from the
research space, it was because

108
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,860
there just weren't any research
platforms out there. Or just

109
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,710
there weren't many there were
very very few research platforms

110
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,190
out there, which could handle a
reasonable outdoor terrain.

111
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,700
There was a lot of indoor
platforms like you know, there

112
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,760
was a bunch of still a bunch of
old like, our wi indoor

113
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,910
platforms around there was is
that is that a company? Or was

114
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,490
Yeah, that was real real
interface. Okay. And you had you

115
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,400
know, the at the time it was
mobile robots then became adept

116
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,640
mobile robots and is now Homer
on but you had there, the

117
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:41,190
Pioneer three, three, dx was a
very, very much a workhorse. You

118
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,340
had people who are hacking
roombas around and the first

119
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,610
create was being used, but these
were all indoor platforms. And

120
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,280
the researchers there were
obvious there obviously, there

121
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,740
was Outdoor Research happening,
right, like the CMU robotics

122
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,500
Institute was, you know, had
been doing outdoor robotics

123
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,870
research for for decades. But it
wasn't a very common thing. And

124
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,810
we that's where we said it,
that's where we're gonna get

125
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,610
started. That's we're gonna make
our mark by building these

126
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,760
really solid robots that could
unlock entirely brand new fields

127
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,490
of field robotics work. That's
really where we got started.

128
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,910
It's almost ironic that auto was
that when we started auto, it's

129
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,520
almost entirely focused on
indoors. But that's that's

130
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,180
another story.

131
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,850
Yeah, that is funny. Okay, so
you were working on these

132
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,940
platforms? And just Can you give
me a sense of what they look

133
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,180
like overall, like a lot of the
platforms that are used for

134
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,730
outdoor use? What do they look
like?

135
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,840
You know, generally most of the
platforms we have their their

136
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,910
black and yellow and they have
four wheels. Yeah. And it's one

137
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,770
of those and research is
probably one of ours.

138
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,480
Yeah. And they so they mostly
they it's like a big flat spot

139
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,030
on the top where you can attach
different things that you might

140
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,550
more cameras more, anything
else.

141
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,570
So yeah, that was generally what
we wanted to build. I mean, we

142
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,230
knew that the software space in
robotics wasn't quite ready for

143
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,630
the software platform yet, but
we knew the world was ready for

144
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,380
physical platforms and we took
that somewhat literally. So

145
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,340
building some big

146
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,800
software platform, what do you
mean,

147
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,310
the worldwide software platform
I would mean something you know,

148
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,850
like the iPhone where you have,
you can write software, right

149
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,850
you don't need to change any
hardware. We're now at the port

150
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,330
Now further along that curve.
But yeah, we we tried to make it

151
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,010
really easy for us to integrate
things we tried to make it easy

152
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,010
for our customers to integrate
things the sort of robots that

153
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,560
if you decided that you're in
the field and something needed

154
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,290
to work and you could take a
hammer to it, you could take a

155
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,980
drill to it that it would work
you can you know, pack it

156
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,130
together and get it out do your
research and get it back in the

157
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,610
field we to the point where we
would I don't know if we still

158
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,300
sell these but we would sell
replacement top plates only for

159
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,080
when someone just wanted to, you
know drill and tap the top plate

160
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,310
for some research gear and then
later they realize either they

161
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,860
made a mistake. They really like
it. And you can take the top

162
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,050
plate with all your sensors, you
could put it on the shelf and

163
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,990
you could you could share the
asset around right that's that's

164
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,190
that was actually a very well,
it's still a really common thing

165
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,980
now that you have self driving
vehicles where you would get a,

166
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,960
you have a dozen researchers but
only one physical robot, right?

167
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,570
Because you could only afford
one, one sensor setup. Now

168
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,750
there's research labs where you
can have things like, you'll

169
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,930
have things ranging from, you
know, the turtlebot, three, all

170
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,140
the way up to like our, our war
hog and moose platforms, for

171
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,650
example, which are on a larger
size. But it was it was very

172
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,850
much like, Well, you know, at
the time, you had the PRT robots

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,730
in the field, and there you have
an entire research lab, which

174
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,120
was around those PR twos. But
even for the labs, which

175
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,210
couldn't afford that, they were
still bought, they would buy

176
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,850
like our Husky platform, which
was our first and actually one

177
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,170
of the most iconic platforms we
make. And you'd have to share

178
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,540
it, right you have this this
little robot, it's got a bunch

179
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,760
of sensors, you need to share it
among all your students.

180
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,040
That is nice. It's clever to
just replace the top plate. That

181
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,300
seems like a good solution. So
let's see, are there any

182
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,620
particularly interesting Apple,
I'm sure that people are using

183
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,870
your platforms for tons of
things, but are there any that

184
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:23,280
were like, particularly
interesting or surprising uses?

185
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,190
Well, if I go outside the if I
if I ignore some of the

186
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:36,120
confidential stuff, there's the
one which I saw most recently,

187
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,300
which, which surprised me and I
didn't I didn't actually know

188
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:45,360
about this one until I saw it in
the news, but was a college

189
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:50,520
which was using the boxer which
is a industrial autonomous

190
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,460
mobile robot that Clearpath
sells, which is actually a

191
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:59,400
variant of the auto Amr. So it's
a boat, 100 kilos, 100 kilos

192
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,570
built, like it can survive a
factory because it can, and it

193
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,350
was used, it was being used for
robotics or applications

194
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:12,420
research at St. Clair college, I
believe. By recently, obviously,

195
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,660
people have needed to do all
sorts of, you know, working

196
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,870
remotely schooling remotely and
what have you. And they rigged

197
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,600
it up as a, they may rigged it
up as a moving clothes, horse or

198
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,840
clothes, or like clothing model
for lack of a better term, where

199
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,470
they had a fashion, they have a
fashion program at the school.

200
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,060
And it was very important for
them to see to see how the

201
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,290
clothes would move. Like how
like how they would drape when

202
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,790
they would move and they get the
and it's like you can't you're

203
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
you're doing all this judging
and exhibiting remotely and you

204
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,540
can't you're not just gonna set
them all up and mannequins and

205
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,760
leave it like that and have the
judges look at it so they would

206
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,470
actually swap out these I can't
exactly remember how they how

207
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,380
they held the clothes on top the
robotic It was a mannequin or

208
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:05,190
mannequin or something else. But
they would they would swap them

209
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,040
out and and run the fashion show
like that. I thought that was

210
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,410
just you know, that was really
really interesting. I mean,

211
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,110
everyone hears about everyone.
Here's what the disinfection

212
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,510
robots that people built in the
last year like I don't know how

213
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,580
many have been built on our
platform, but everyone hears

214
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,400
about those but you never hear
about these. These little like

215
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,100
that. Yes, the clothes modeling
robot.

216
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:28,860
That's hilarious. What a great
youth. Oh, yeah. Okay, and then

217
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,130
one thing that's been very
interesting to me from your

218
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,180
previous talks and things, your
robots they're designed to be

219
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,230
super reliable, like go forever.
Can you talk a bit about this

220
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,470
from the from the beginning, we
would, we would joke with our,

221
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,820
with our prospects that that the
reliability standard standard

222
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,650
for our robots is is outlast the
researchers. That was the that

223
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,800
was the idea. Even at the clear
path, even at the Clearpath

224
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,580
robotics side of things where
the standards are not as high as

225
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,380
on the on the industrial front.
But that was the goal it was you

226
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,730
should never have to you should
never have to cut short your

227
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,200
field robotics research because
of frankly, bad weather. And I

228
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,250
think that comes from that comes
from us all us all being

229
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,550
Canadian are all the early the
founders and the early employees

230
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,430
all being Canadian, is that when
you're out there testing your

231
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,990
robots like one half of the
effective school year the winter

232
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,280
term, it's sort of slow and when
the snow leaves it gets replaced

233
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,450
by mud. So we really wanted to
not get in the way and not have

234
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,260
to worry about not have to worry
about the snow or not have to

235
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,060
worry about the rain. So that
was that was our initial

236
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,990
standard. And then we've kept
pushing from there and this was

237
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:54,030
a very interesting time for
robotics because the this we

238
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:58,290
were able to mature along with
the market expectations. These

239
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,740
days if you're starting robotics
calm It's just got to work.

240
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,670
Like, you know, you're compared
against, you know, robots like,

241
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,480
like ours are fetches as they
are now, you're not compared

242
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,670
against the robots that we had
10 years ago. But that's that's

243
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,630
what the market does.

244
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:23,250
Yeah, it matures. That is
interesting. So it's really

245
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,800
changed as the market has grown.
And people expect a product now,

246
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,400
what do you guys do differently,
to make it so that your robots

247
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,490
are even more reliable than they
were in the past, which was

248
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,600
still super reliable.

249
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,010
The thing that's really helped
is the fact that the rest of the

250
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:46,410
world has now caught on to the
potential power of robotics. So

251
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:51,870
it means that it's easier for us
to build partnerships with other

252
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,690
companies who have a lot of some
of the who have some of this

253
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,440
fundamental fundamental
expertise, like sensors,

254
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,190
sensors, or actuators, or
simulation systems. I think

255
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,670
that's been that's been really
helpful. So even a lot of the

256
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,000
larger robots, for example, like
Clearpath, robotics cells are

257
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,330
built in partnership with
vehicle suppliers. So where the

258
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,150
robotics experts, but we
actually work with other vehicle

259
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:20,190
experts, or, or even more
recently, more recently, it was

260
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,010
very, you know, well covered in
the robotics media that we did

261
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,490
a, we're doing a we have rather
a partnership with, with Boston

262
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,360
Dynamics for the research space.
And that just makes sense,

263
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,780
right? Boston Dynamics is, is
one of the leading if not the

264
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:39,090
leading manufacturer of legged
robots in the world. And we're

265
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,630
the world's leading integrator
and solver of these problems. So

266
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:47,340
it was it just made sense that,
that our clients in the world

267
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,930
needed more legged robots. And
now that that's possible. And

268
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,270
why would we try to do that
ourselves? Right, work with

269
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,560
those who've already picked it

270
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,140
up? Yeah. Interesting. So going
back to working with the vehicle

271
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,730
companies, so do take advantage
of their existing supply chain

272
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,230
and their existing processes? Or
reps, how does that work? Ah,

273
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,770
yeah,

274
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,980
well, ya know, they go hand in
some cases, the vehicle in some

275
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,060
cases, the vehicle shows up,
like at our door, where it's

276
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,060
been a repurposed vehicle where
they've remanufactured parts of

277
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:27,630
it, and then we will take it and
turn it from, you know, a, what

278
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,290
might be described as a giant
remote control car into this ROS

279
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:35,820
enabled fully integrated
research platform, you know,

280
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,710
upgraded power systems, upgraded
power systems, onboard compute

281
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,160
all of the sensor options that
we might have all of the

282
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,460
customization options that we've
got. So just like early days,

283
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,420
you could call us up, you know,
10 years ago and say that my

284
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,510
research, hypothetically, my
research is in, you know, mobile

285
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,880
manipulation and unknown
environments. And we would turn

286
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,960
around and say, Okay, well,
maybe if your budget is x, then

287
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,530
you can't do the 3d LIDAR. But
you can get an arm like this,

288
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,670
and you can get a camera. We've
got that same, we've got that

289
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:16,620
same. That same political
experience for for everything

290
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,770
else we do. It's really about
providing like I said, this

291
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,770
conference, one of the last
conferences, I was actually able

292
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,730
to speak out in person that are
we do have very reliable robots.

293
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,050
But in the end, what we, what we
sell, is, is the ability to

294
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,000
speed up the robotics
development cycle.

295
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:40,020
Hmm, definitely not true. And
just out of curiosity, where are

296
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,660
most of the manufacturers that
actually build the robots you

297
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,260
guys make?

298
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,090
There's a lot we work with, in
Well, in Ontario, Ontario has a

299
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,170
lot of vehicle manufacturers,
we've been we've been broadening

300
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:56,940
that. So traditionally, we've
been very heavy on still

301
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,740
building our own vehicles. And
where we've really got the

302
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,100
broadest reach will be in the
manipulation and setting spaces

303
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,490
because those markets have been
more mature for a while. In

304
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,450
those in those you can really,
you can imagine the countries in

305
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,120
particular like you know,
Germany and Japan are the two

306
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,690
probably largest companies on
those fronts, but that's

307
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,970
probably not a surprise to
anyone. America, Denmark, I

308
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,800
mean, you are we were we had we
worked with universal robots on

309
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,630
a custom skew for ourselves and
our clients. I don't know how

310
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,920
you go, this was what sorry,
stock keeping unit. It's a sort

311
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,520
of custom configuration of their
arm. So you're typically when

312
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,630
you bought a universal robot
arm, you needed to and you want

313
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,990
it to do research with it. The
Universal robot arm would have

314
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,200
you'd have the arm and then you
would have a control box which

315
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,620
is a giant control box meant for
industrial relatively decent

316
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,920
size meant for industrial floors
and it had three boards in it.

317
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,720
It had an A power supply board,
which was effectively a, you

318
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,090
know, transformer and step down,
or interactive rectifier and

319
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:14,100
step down transformer. And so
getting the power, yeah, power

320
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,640
regulator, yeah, then you'd have
a Safety Safety Board and a

321
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,260
controller board and have that
you have this giant enclosure,

322
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,640
and a big power supply. But it
turns out that most of our large

323
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,930
vehicles, supply the power
already supply the power at the

324
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:35,040
spec needed, because they have a
big DC, they have a big DC buses

325
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,790
on them for power. So if you
wanted to, if you wanted to

326
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,650
integrate a mobile or AI, your
robot onto a mobile robot, you

327
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:49,950
would have to put in a an
inverter like you would you

328
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:55,200
would need an inverter to go up
to AC, and then you would end up

329
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,040
what would end up happening
inside this black box, which was

330
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,600
also kind of large was that then
then it would end up losing more

331
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,730
power, because you're just
stepping it all the way down to

332
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,010
DC. So we had a race

333
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,730
to AC and then back to DC

334
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,940
and then back to DC, right,
which is generally a waste. Yep.

335
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:19,470
So it's wasted amount of wasted
space. And, and just extra cost.

336
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,190
So we came to an agreement with
them where we would, we would go

337
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,890
by the arms and by the two
boards, and then we would mount

338
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:30,330
them ourselves. And you were you
used to have this this ratchet,

339
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,690
just huge package, that package
was no longer there because we

340
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,080
could mount the components
inside of inside of the the

341
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,080
chassis itself. And that was
great. So that was the court

342
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,250
sort of partnerships, which we
were always forging, which was

343
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,330
to open up these brand new
markets for these partners, and

344
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,870
serve our customers really cool
in time because like we're

345
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,240
already we've already got our
hands full building the basis,

346
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,650
we're not going to build the
arms too.

347
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,300
Yeah. So you said that you guys
kind of your core competence

348
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,840
would be like as an integrator,
if I understood correctly of

349
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,450
basically taking the platform
and then adding pieces to it so

350
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,030
that the robotics community or
anyone who wanted to do

351
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,760
something with the robot could
use it. Right?

352
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:18,060
Or more, more and more. So I
mean, we're, we're very good at

353
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:22,560
vehicle design. Yeah, but you
know, we have been, there's just

354
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,850
now that the world is picking
up. These, you know, now that

355
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,790
the world is really engaging
with the robotics space in the

356
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:33,270
automation space. It's, it's
just, there's just more demand

357
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,540
that we can almost deal with,
like, it's one thing to maintain

358
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,450
a vehicle demand, like a vehicle
portfolio of a half dozen to a

359
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,660
dozen vehicles, which is what we
have, and we're proud of every

360
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:47,280
single one of them. But there's
so many different opportunities

361
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,480
out there that we've had to,
we've had to really partner in

362
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,080
order to keep everyone keep
growing to keep focused on what

363
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,850
we're good at. Yeah. And then
and so in this role, it's a lot

364
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,850
of taking an existing platform
and you retrofit it with

365
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:08,340
components and software, or how
would you think of that? Like,

366
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,770
what do you do when you get a
new platform, or it's probably

367
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,440
quite case by case. But yeah,
it's

368
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,140
very case by case I mean, you we
don't want to, we don't usually

369
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,490
just, you know, buy some random,
some like, I don't know, buy a

370
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,120
car off the lot and customize
it, we, we want to make sure

371
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,210
that we want to make sure that
we can provide this continual

372
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,770
discontinuous solution for
people, which means that we'll

373
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,530
we'll usually have already
spoken to the manufacturer,

374
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,190
we've we've come to some kind of
agreement with them, the you

375
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,580
know, the degree of which is is
always case by case, but we're

376
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,210
not trying to guess at things
right, we don't want to, we

377
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:49,830
don't want to do something a
little bit Renegade, where, you

378
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:53,490
know, you you buy a, you know,
you buy an ATV off the lot, and

379
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,450
then you kind of hope it works.
Because the customers, the

380
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,420
customers expect it to be
maintainable and for, you know,

381
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,060
spare parts to be available.
That's, that's the other reason

382
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:07,320
why people will, will work with
us is because when all of their

383
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,230
grad students have left or when
their research projects have

384
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:14,490
gone on to, to production, those
robots will still be there. And

385
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,280
they want to, they want the next
set of researchers in the next

386
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,720
set of robotics developers to be
able to, to just, you know, jump

387
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,840
on board, for sure. Now,

388
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:31,410
you mentioned how customers come
to you with problems and then

389
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,530
kind of you see if you can find
something that fits the how has

390
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:38,910
that changed while you've grown
over the last 12 years?

391
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:47,670
The problems are a lot more the
problems are a lot more diverse.

392
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,490
And what people are looking for
mannequin the Yeah. Well, that

393
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,380
one was good. We need to know
about that one. They just they

394
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:01,440
just did it. But on the plus
side, I think they're is a

395
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,600
growing appreciation for a
growing appreciation for what

396
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,010
robots can and can't do. Right?
Like when we started the even

397
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,940
the concept of a drone that you
could just casually buy, it

398
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:20,250
wasn't a thing. One of the, the,
the company I, company I

399
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,600
internship I interned at was
called aireon Labs, and they've

400
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,900
just been purchased by FLIR and
they sold drones for first

401
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,830
responders. And at the time that
they had started, you couldn't

402
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,680
buy an autonomous drone for
autonomous quadcopter. There

403
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,020
there was, there was no money
that you could pay to the

404
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,600
market, which would get you a
reliable autonomous quadcopter,

405
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,810
short of funding an entire
robotics company yourself. So

406
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,690
that was that was where we were
right. And self driving cars.

407
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,440
You know, the the urban
challenge was, was just one at

408
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,270
the time, I can't even remember
what year the the urban

409
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,960
challenge was. But that was just
around that timeframe, like

410
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,830
autonomous cars weren't a thing.
So there was still a little bit

411
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,770
of a sense of robots could
either do nothing, or they could

412
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:05,340
do everything. So early on,
there was a lot more need to

413
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:13,140
reset expectations. And on top
of that, there was wood on top

414
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,800
of that,

415
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,870
or, yeah, so you're saying
people would either think they

416
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,170
could do everything or nothing,
kind of like useless or they

417
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:26,100
will just be the Jetsons Butler
kind of thing effectively? Yeah,

418
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,430
gotcha. And so bring people down
to the level that robots

419
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:34,080
actually can do. And kind of
show them how they can be useful

420
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,140
still, with what they have? Or
is that we that's, that's where

421
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,680
we are right

422
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,990
now. Right? Like, you can. In
when, when we had when we were

423
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,190
starting, you know, there there
would be there were probably a

424
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:51,330
few 1000 people in the world,
who knew who could reasonably

425
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,820
describe the state of the self
driving vehicle market, like

426
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,760
where the technology readiness
level of the self driving

427
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,200
vehicle market. But now, I would
charitably guess that there are

428
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,960
millions of people on earth who
can generally describe what a

429
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,570
self driving vehicle is. And
isn't, they know what it is. And

430
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,180
they know it's not taking you to
Starbucks anytime soon. Without

431
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,270
a a well paid test driver in the
front, are you still paying 10?

432
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:17,100
Yeah. But that's that's not how
it works. So you'd have, you'd

433
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,790
either be, you know, selling to
someone because you knew there's

434
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,330
an opportunity there, and they
didn't really think that it was

435
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,840
possible, or they would come to
you with an opportunity. Now,

436
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,360
this is beyond the researchers,
this is when the commercial

437
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,090
demand started to take an
uptake. But you'd have people

438
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,390
coming in and saying, Yeah,
like, Can I pay, you know,

439
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:42,390
$5,000 to automate my old,
clunky gas powered lawnmower,

440
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,300
and have it run completely
unsupervised, through the middle

441
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:50,220
of a park in a crowded day.
There was a lot more requests

442
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,910
like that, huh, there are still
there. Just to be clear, there

443
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:58,500
are still requests like that.
But they are. But there are far

444
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,320
more requests, where the people
who come in the door are already

445
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,440
conditioned, and already
educated about what robots can

446
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,780
and can't do. And I think
that's, that's a that's just

447
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,750
wonderful for everybody, right?
Like, that's saves everyone a

448
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,500
whole lot of time.

449
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,660
And so if you're getting
requests like that, where

450
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,110
they're coming in and asking if
this is possible, and how much

451
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,710
it would be, that means that you
guys have to be extremely

452
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:25,740
knowledgeable about the state of
the art in probably a lot of

453
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,810
different areas. Because I mean,
there's the hardware, there's

454
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:32,760
the software component, and all
the specific things that are no

455
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:37,410
sensors how to estimate things.
Like you guys kind of have to be

456
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:40,140
broadly competent in a lot of
robotics. Yes.

457
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:48,240
Yeah. It's a it's a challenge.
Um, but the thing that gives us

458
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,750
that's been interesting, well,
and I'll speaking for me

459
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,360
personally, and it's one of the
reasons I love this work so

460
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:59,310
much, is because every day
there's a new, there's some new

461
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,740
development out in the world, in
the robotics space that's gonna

462
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,130
make that's gonna make a new
application possible. It's a new

463
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,000
technology and like, every day,
there's something new that I've

464
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,570
that I can learn. Like, I just
actually right before this, I

465
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,020
was I was reading a paper or
reading a paper put together

466
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,530
that's, that's, um, I don't know
if it's been accepted or if it's

467
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,050
been final submissions for iros,
which is a big robotics

468
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:25,710
conference. And it's, it's
authored by people who work for

469
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,830
Clearpath that's, that's just
great. And I reading through the

470
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,830
paper and realizing that my math
has really gone down the drain.

471
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,690
But anyway, I digress. Um, the
The other thing, which I mean,

472
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,150
it sounds kind of intimidating,
which is like our job is to stay

473
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,850
up to date with everything in
the field, which is robotics at

474
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:47,340
all times. But it's as, as odd
as it sounds. It's not that

475
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:52,530
challenging, because we don't
have to do any catch up. Like if

476
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:55,500
you're starting a robotics
company now. You have a lot of

477
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:01,230
catching up to do. Right like
you have decades. of progress

478
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:06,360
and you have all sorts of you
know labs to track you, you need

479
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,120
to know where to pay attention
who to pay attention to which

480
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,630
conferences to go to like all of
it, you need to catch up with

481
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,880
the state of the art and I had
that as you're doing that the

482
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,940
state of the art always
changing. But you know, we got

483
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,510
to do that work before this the
field before the the the

484
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:25,110
robotics field really blew up.
So now it's just it's it's day

485
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,710
for day.

486
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,620
So you wrote rode the wave,
basically. And now you're still

487
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,130
on it,

488
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,340
which is fantastic. We're just
we're just holding on now. But

489
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,730
it's, it's a lot easier than
then, than trying to catch it

490
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,870
from nothing right now.

491
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,050
How do you? Do you structure
your team with like experts in

492
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,020
specific areas? Or is it the
team of generalists? Or how do

493
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,220
you how would you think about
it?

494
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:51,420
So my team? Yeah, we're the team
as a whole if you include the

495
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,980
auto motors business unit, which
is a large portion and, you

496
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,200
know, sharing services and
everything like that. We're

497
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,540
about 200 to eight 280 to 300
people were in there. That range

498
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:03,960
right now,

499
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:11,190
are you all in Waterloo, Toronto
area, or were in the bay, I

500
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,060
believe, you

501
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:17,790
know, we, our offices, our
physical offices, we have four

502
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:23,340
facilities in, in the Kitchener
Waterloo Region. So if you know

503
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,170
the area, there's one in
Waterloo, there's two in

504
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:29,100
Kitchener, and there's one on
the near side of Cambridge, and

505
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,120
everything else is everything
else is remote work. And

506
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,660
actually, a lot of that was like
all of our sales team. And a lot

507
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,210
of our field team were remote
before even the pandemic hit

508
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,820
that was had some, you know,
engineers working remote here

509
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:48,690
and there. But overall, you
know, overall, Canada is

510
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,810
probably you know, if I don't
know these numbers offhand, but

511
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:57,060
I would guess 90 to 95% of the
people that we have our, you

512
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:00,060
know, live live in Canada live
in, you know, southwestern

513
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:04,050
Ontario. And then though there's
the next percentage, there'll be

514
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,580
a rounding error of people who
are full time around the world.

515
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,890
So there's someone who's in
someone in Mexico right now,

516
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:14,160
there's someone in Spain, we
have a full time member of our

517
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,670
team in Japan, and then everyone
else, everyone else is in the

518
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,790
US. So there's a lot of a lot of
salespeople in the US field

519
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:25,410
service tax systems, engineers,
people like that. Because

520
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:29,250
there's really obviously a big
export market for us is PS

521
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,350
autonomous systems into the US.
So

522
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:39,150
gotcha. And then for like, Is it
about the specialized versus

523
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,830
generalist approach? Oh, yeah.

524
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:46,710
Yeah. There's so there's,
there's probably about there's

525
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,180
under 20 people at the company
who would have had robotics

526
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,920
experience before they joined
us,

527
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:56,820
that would be Wow, my guess
that's great. Okay. So whether

528
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,220
that's whether that's mobile
robotics experience, like, you

529
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,060
know, AGV deployment in
industry, or, you know, a

530
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,020
Master's or PhD, it's, it's
probably around that number. I

531
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,860
know, the the autonomy group in
the auto space, the on the, the

532
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,630
auto business unit has 14, I
believe, 14 people, it's all

533
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:19,050
masters and PhDs, doing various
sorts of product development and

534
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:23,280
research, for example. But
beyond that, we really try to

535
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,820
bring in experts and experienced
people in their fields, whether

536
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:31,020
that's, you know, operations,
manufacturing, finance, sales,

537
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,460
wherever, and then even in
engineering, like I have, I

538
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,000
think it's seven people who
report to me right now, not a

539
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,560
single one, not a single one
started in a robotic space, and

540
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,310
only one of them had any
experience in robotics before

541
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:51,930
joining this. Wow. So it really
is, and, but people learn really

542
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:56,340
quickly, right? Like we as we've
got this foundation is, you

543
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,660
know, foundation of technology.
The the analogy I often make is,

544
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,590
if you go to, you know, you look
at a company like Audi, for

545
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:07,410
example, or you know, any
established high tech company,

546
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,550
how many people go into that
high tech company with expertise

547
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,040
in that the thing that makes
that high tech company special,

548
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,340
like, how many people work at
SpaceX, and of those, how many

549
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,160
are rocket scientists? Yeah,
like how many people work at

550
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,800
Audi and of those, how many
people actually know how to

551
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,180
build an engine? Right? Like,

552
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,700
definitely, that seems like
something like as a result of

553
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,030
the robotics field maturing, I
feel like like at the beginning,

554
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,000
it was probably a lot more
roboticists and now it's, people

555
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,760
have other specializations that
can contribute, because it's

556
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,550
large enough that they can focus
on something that they have

557
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,270
skills for.

558
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,410
Yeah, well, and that was
actually a big thing for us when

559
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:52,140
we decided to start getting into
getting into the industrial

560
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:56,850
space in general was hiring
people who weren't roboticists,

561
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:00,240
because you know this. This has
changed over the years, but You

562
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,180
know, back when we were
starting, you know, maybe 10% of

563
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,360
roboticist could write any kind
of decent code that you would

564
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,550
want running in a production
application. And I'm probably

565
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:13,380
being, I'm probably being
generous there. And that's not

566
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,380
an insult, because I don't think
I'd count myself as one of those

567
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,820
10%. But when we started really
going after the industrial

568
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,220
market, it was important to hire
people who had written good

569
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,360
software. So that's, that's what
we did. And these days, I'd say

570
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:33,300
our ratio is for every person
who writes, for every three

571
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,480
people who write software,
there's one roboticist and one

572
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,630
tester, that's probably the
rough ratio that we have.

573
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:45,240
Gotcha. Very interesting. Let's
see. So moving into software,

574
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:52,530
you at Clearpath. Were some
early adopters and supporter of

575
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,010
the robot operating system. Ros,
would you tell me a bit about

576
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,190
that

577
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:02,580
work? Yeah, I can still remember
a lot of those discussions like

578
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:07,770
they were yesterday, we started,
we started the company formally

579
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:13,650
in 2009. And at that point, we
had the philosophy that there

580
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,800
was always going to be more
smart people outside of the

581
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,500
company than inside a company.
That's, that's almost like a

582
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,110
statement of fact, for any
company, no matter how big. And

583
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,930
we said, we're going to start
with, we're gonna start with

584
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:29,190
open source. And that was number
one for that, that general

585
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,010
observation I just outlined. And
the other one is that one of our

586
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,190
largest competitors at the time,
really, really charged a lot of

587
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,730
researchers money for this
expensive autonomy package. Like

588
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,730
if you wanted to buy a laser,
you also needed to buy this

589
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,370
really expensive autonomy
package. And we did market

590
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,610
surveys of the early early
researchers to those people who

591
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:51,030
were who participated in that 12
year, 12 year old market survey,

592
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:54,420
thank you. And almost every one
of them said they didn't like

593
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,100
paying for the software because
they were going to write it

594
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:01,920
themselves anyway. So I said,
Okay, we will start with a small

595
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:06,510
open source software package
called player stage, because

596
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:11,940
eba, which was a combination of
three player, which is you can

597
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,660
look at that as an equivalent to
ROS stage, which is a 2d

598
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,300
simulation environment meant for
multi robot simulations and

599
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,030
gazebo, which most people still
know, because it's still around.

600
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,710
simulation. And yeah, so we
started with player was a

601
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,760
message passing precursor to
ROS. Right, right. This kind of

602
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,310
thing. Okay, so you started with
those.

603
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,500
We started with those. And then
in in 2010, we went to our first

604
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:43,830
official trade show, which was
ekra 2010. In the in Anchorage,

605
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,820
Alaska. Oh, wow. The say we'll
just say that those trade shows

606
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:53,280
are a lot classier now. But we
saw and met the crew from Willow

607
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,610
Garage. And one of the things
which was really interesting,

608
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,800
and they had their PR two out,
and they were doing all sorts of

609
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,080
fancy stuff, and they're way,
way better funded than we have.

610
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:08,400
But the thing that really was
impressive is that if you've

611
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,040
ever installed player stage,
it's a bit of a challenge. And,

612
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:20,670
and the Willow Garage team had
put so much effort into making

613
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:25,680
ROS not only just a good piece
of software, but also well

614
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,520
documented and easy to install.
And it just seemed like the way

615
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,420
to go. And we knew that people
from the player stage community

616
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,650
had gone over to the, you know,
being supported by were part of

617
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,660
Willow Garage are being
supported by Willow Garage like

618
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,490
Brian querque, first and
foremost. And then, so we said

619
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,740
that, okay, this is going to be
the way it's going to go. Right?

620
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,700
This is the only place which is
actually funding, not just some

621
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,490
software, but the community
around the software. So we

622
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:57,630
basically turned at the drop of
the hat and said, you know,

623
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,630
probably that that would have
been April, May and 2010. and I

624
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:05,520
are going back to going back to
Mike who's our first engineer,

625
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,150
first engineer at the company
saying like we need to, we need

626
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,730
to start this supporting this
ROS thing is starting to talk to

627
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:14,700
our customers about it. So to
the best of my knowledge, we

628
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,030
were the first company. We're
the first company in the world

629
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:24,090
that probably made money off off
of something tied to ROS. That's

630
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,180
awesome. And that was the case
for a very long time for years.

631
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,640
A bunch of these other companies
in the space, we're just having

632
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,670
an HIE and I'm like we need to
support ROS and that you could

633
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,060
you could get these other robots
to be supported but it was

634
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,420
always some third party some
third party like a library

635
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,000
written by a grad student who
happened to have that robot in

636
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,620
the shop. You can like dross and
these these days and then you

637
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,590
know things continue to progress
from there we have been talking

638
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:54,390
no early days about the creation
of at the time was called the

639
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,420
ROS foundation. That was the the
name for it. But now you know it

640
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,760
is the open source robotics
foundation. So that got founded

641
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,230
I joined the board for that. The
turtle bot turtle bot was an

642
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:08,550
interesting story. So that that
was obviously created by by

643
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:13,200
Melanie wise, you know, at
fetcher, I guess they were just

644
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,920
acquired. So congratulations to
them. And intelli foot is still

645
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,770
at the store with Open Robotics.
And they created this turtle bot

646
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:25,290
thing, which is a really cool
idea. And we had a smaller, a

647
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,560
more extensible, but more
expensive, but more far more

648
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,600
expensive educational platform
available at the time, and said

649
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:37,410
no, like this is and the other
thing that happened around the

650
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,110
turtlebot was that the Microsoft
Kinect came out, it was just the

651
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,560
perfect sensor. Like that was
the first commercially available

652
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,600
RGB sensor. So

653
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:49,380
then there's a camera and depth.

654
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,060
Camera. Yes. And, and that meant
that you never needed to worry

655
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,920
about LIDAR, right? Like you
didn't have to worry about the

656
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,710
laser, at least for small scale
stuff. So that was really cool.

657
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,820
And it turns out that Melanie
and Talia were tired of putting

658
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,910
turtle bots together by hand. So
we, we had a conversation and

659
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:12,660
ended up that we we supplied
Willow Garage with a ton of

660
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,470
turtle quads, and then became
the first manufacturer. First

661
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:19,230
manufacturer turtle bots in the
world. I can't I can't remember

662
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:23,430
who else was there? There was
Bill Morris from the company. He

663
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,650
has his own business called I
heard robots, or I heard

664
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,170
engineering, I think it's
changed between those names. And

665
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,420
I think there was a third
company at the time, I think

666
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,550
they were they're off in Europe,
but I can't remember who it was.

667
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,060
And it was like that was like 10
years ago. But that was also a

668
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,090
really interesting thing at the
time that, you know, we decided

669
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,550
we kill their own product,
because we think of the

670
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,070
turtlebot was going to gain
momentum in it. It certainly

671
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:50,160
did. And then yeah, other stuff
around like ROSCon i was, that

672
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,580
was what 2012 was the first
ROSCon. So we helped, we helped

673
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,240
found that. And that's still
going strong. I know literally

674
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,200
right before the right before
the we got on this call here. I

675
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,010
just finished my finished mice
my share of the reviews for

676
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,290
ROSCon 2021.

677
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,680
So we Orleans in this year, New
Orleans, that'll be a blast.

678
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:15,570
But it's been exciting, right?
Like the ROS community was huge,

679
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,530
or it's it just completely mind
blowing, the sort of things that

680
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:23,700
we've seen here like we when,
when you started when we started

681
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,400
both pockets when we started
there, ROS was out there. But

682
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,090
even when we started supporting
ROS, no manufacturer was out

683
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,550
there supporting ROS and knows,
like every sensor that you

684
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,910
needed to get into ROS here it
was written by, you know, Willow

685
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,940
Garage, it was written by us, it
was written by some grad student

686
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,660
halfway around the world like,
but now now you get a sensor or

687
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,320
you get a robot from any
reputable manufacturer, and

688
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,920
there's probably a ROS driver
for it. I remember getting a new

689
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,530
prototype sensor from a, we'll
just say it's a well known

690
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:56,550
manufacturer. And the only
instructions on how to use the

691
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:01,740
sensor was was like install the
package we gave you. And it's

692
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:06,450
ROS launch this. Yeah, that was
the instruction. And Previous to

693
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,570
that, and previous to that, like
every sensor manufacturer had

694
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:13,920
their own their own, usually
Java implemented sensor

695
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,860
visualization package. Some
still do, and I don't blame

696
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,050
them. But it's been this, that's
the sort of thing which is

697
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:22,620
really interesting is, you know,
first they would go from what's

698
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,680
ROS from, you know, they just
didn't know what it was they

699
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,790
didn't care. And then later we
would, you know, be trying to

700
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:31,800
lean on them a little bit and
say, Well, if you want us to

701
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,740
sell this new sensor you have
make it easier for us to build a

702
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,830
ROS driver or like release your
package online or do something.

703
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,430
You know, at that point. It's
like you I can I can almost

704
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,920
guarantee you that your own
engineers have a ROS driver if

705
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,390
you go and ask them. So just put
that on. Yeah. Yeah. And and now

706
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,970
we're at the point where the
sensors just you just come out

707
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:54,270
of the box, you don't need to
ask. And that's huge, right? Mm

708
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:54,660
hmm.

709
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,630
Let's see. So and you use ROS
for everything connecting

710
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:06,030
everything on your system, even
early on. Is it true? Yeah.

711
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:10,260
That's awesome. And so now how
are you guys involved in the

712
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,990
community with ROS? So you're
obviously still a part of it?

713
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,120
Yeah, definitely.

714
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,960
Well, you know, still on the
still on the board still running

715
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:24,090
ROSCon. Our ability to stay up
to date with all the recent

716
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:26,760
versions ebbs and flows. So I
apologize to anyone in the

717
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,770
community who is or who, when we
get when we caught a little get

718
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,080
caught a little bit behind the
ball on whatever the recent

719
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:39,420
releases. All of the auto
autonomy code is all based on

720
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,270
ROS and uses the ROS middleware,
it's on our fleet manager as

721
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:50,820
well. Our inter fleet and robot
comms on the, on the, for auto

722
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,550
for our industrial Amr, or
mobile robots. That's all

723
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,160
process to now. So we've started
to

724
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,100
all the costs of their autos.

725
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:05,420
Yeah, so all the autos all the
autos talking to our fleet, our

726
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,690
fleet manager, that's all based
on ROS two, since that's

727
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:12,560
exciting three, four years back.
And we were the, to the best of

728
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,570
my knowledge, we were one of the
first people to actually use

729
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:17,300
production or ROS to in a
production environment where,

730
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:21,560
you know, if it failed, you
would have angry phone calls. It

731
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,110
was, you know, it wasn't through
the entire stack, right? Like

732
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:28,010
our autonomy system is still
very ROS one based. Didn't

733
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,710
that's just like a legacy thing.
So we're talking about migration

734
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:36,380
plans now. But, but we actually
did an independent investigation

735
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,600
when we needed to really scale
up the amount of robots at a

736
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,590
given factory. And we found that
DDS was actually pretty good,

737
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,010
that DDS was a good direction to
go in and we said, okay, well

738
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:49,040
for if DDS is what's coming out
of this, then let's use ROS,

739
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,040
too. So we did that. And it's
Yeah, it's been great.

740
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:58,130
See, I'm looking, I always
forget what DDS stands for. data

741
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:01,550
distribution service, data
distribution service, and it's a

742
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,950
really, it's a flexible
middleware that allows you to

743
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:09,020
kind of interpolate between TCP,
which is lossless or not, like

744
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:14,150
it doesn't lose data, and UDP
which can lose data, but useful

745
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:17,210
for like walking robots and this
kind of thing, where you don't

746
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:20,960
want to hold it up if you miss
data. Things

747
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:23,990
Yeah, so there's
there's a bunch of stuff in

748
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:28,010
there which is just which was
already implemented, right? Like

749
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:31,940
quality of service quality of
service is a big thing. Some of

750
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,820
the other stuff was just more of
like how it was implemented. So

751
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:43,610
for example, with with ROS one,
both the c++ language, the c++

752
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:48,500
language bindings, or the c++
library and the Python library,

753
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,280
they both independently
implemented the ROS 1 protocol.

754
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:59,000
So it meant the with like so it
meant that 20 was sometimes

755
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,120
babies well twice as much
maintain and then sometimes you

756
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,730
had gotchas like especially
early on where it's like oh that

757
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,460
function and that function and
subscribe well that only works

758
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:11,990
if you use Python great well, or
vice versa. And so that was like

759
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:14,810
another big change that went
with ROS to was you know,

760
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:18,770
implementing everything at a you
know, implement, implementing

761
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:21,140
everything at a sink or the
bindings on top of DDS at a

762
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,900
single layer or a single
language then and then building

763
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,850
on top of that and then the
other thing that's nice about

764
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:30,170
that is that now it does make it
easier to notionally migrate to

765
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:32,930
some newer libraries like I know
rust has been talked about a lot

766
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,790
in the rust community these days
but yeah, there's there's all

767
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:40,610
sorts of other you know, little
things like ROS one was really

768
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:44,510
only built for a single very
complicated robot like one robot

769
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:47,360
that's doing very complicated
things and specifically the PRT

770
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,570
but then people started using it
for fleets and robots really

771
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:54,860
quickly or the other thing is
that people want it people want

772
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,990
to start running ROS on
microcontrollers for obvious

773
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:03,350
reasons and it's it's far easier
to shrink bras to down and then

774
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,920
I think yeah well they're
they're definitely

775
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,470
implementations of rosu that can
run on a microcontroller I'm not

776
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:12,350
sure how public they are it's
always difficult to remember

777
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:16,250
that so I won't mention any
right now but yeah, you can you

778
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:19,100
can fit like you can do a lot of
ROS on a microcontroller which

779
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,090
is now really interesting with
the ROS one days you would have

780
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:26,420
a package called ROS serial for
example which if you wanted to

781
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,450
talk to an Arduino you needed
you put this like lightweight

782
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:33,710
serial protocol on the ROS or on
the Arduino or you know any AVR

783
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,560
chip and you would basically
tell it that he was allowed to

784
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,760
use these know a few of these
language or a few of these these

785
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,150
message types but it wasn't
really ROS so now we're able to

786
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:48,110
do a lot more but there's a lot
more consideration as well for

787
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:51,620
you know real time real time
nature of it which opens up the

788
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:57,200
door to which opens up the door
to you know safety critical ROS

789
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,200
safety critical ROS
implementation is you know, hard

790
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,330
real time guarantees there's all
sorts of interesting stuff

791
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:02,630
there.

792
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:07,010
Audrow Nash: I would say I mean
and I read it, would you talk a

793
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,940
bit about the safety critical
ROS just kind of thing I don't

794
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:15,260
know too much about it. Right
says is it using standards

795
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:17,630
around cross where you see you
can guarantee some sort of

796
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:21,620
performance and if it's real
time you can deterministically

797
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:25,850
say this is going to happen at
this time or we know that this

798
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:27,380
task will complete and this kind
of thing.

799
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:34,940
The the thing which is
so obviously there's various

800
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:40,580
levels of you know, safety of
safety guarantees and up until

801
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,730
now and this is actually
including including our products

802
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:48,950
for example, a lot of the safety
happens at a lower layer under

803
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,590
ROS right on the motor
controllers are their safety

804
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:54,980
relays or their safety PLCs or
safety controllers programmed

805
00:49:54,980 --> 00:50:00,230
and you know, some some safe art
for your jobs or whatever and

806
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:05,030
That's not that's usually not in
ROS now obviously your benefits

807
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:07,490
in so many reasons there are so
many ways to not having to do

808
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:13,700
that and the nice thing is so
Russ to on its own right now you

809
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:18,230
know it's not certified it's not
certified it's not you know if

810
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:22,010
you use everything there in ROS
you're going to be able to do

811
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:26,540
things like sort of like like
under a like a you know under

812
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:31,070
the ages need some sort or yeah
MISRA C language standards or

813
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:36,650
c++ or like ISO 26262 or IEC 61
508 like basically if you love

814
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,990
the standard libraries then you
you probably know what I'm

815
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:45,560
talking about do dash 178 is the
aerospace one so I need ROS ROS

816
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:50,480
to on its own because it
supports by definition so many

817
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,800
different languages like or so
many functions in full c++ then

818
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,760
it's not going to be certified
on its own right because you can

819
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,530
do things with c++ which are
considered not safe if you

820
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:07,730
really really try to be specific
like and you're trying to write

821
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:11,300
something that's you know safety
readable very high levels like

822
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:15,440
you know can run a nuclear power
plant levels and and what have

823
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,290
you that you need to avoid
things like any kind of dynamic

824
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:24,830
memory allocation ever. And so
obviously, if you if you if the

825
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:29,300
ROS community built a toolset
that didn't ever let you use any

826
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:33,230
dynamic memory allocation then
that would we'll just say not be

827
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,250
adopted because there's a lot of
places where that doesn't

828
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:41,870
matter. We actually built safety
rated systems and we have we've

829
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:46,010
made certain choices that
optimize towards time to market

830
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:48,920
at the expense of a little bit
of extra cost on the safety

831
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,550
system right but that means that
we can use the full gamut of c++

832
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:56,180
or Python functions now but
there are companies and there

833
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:02,660
are initiatives out there where
they have been able to trim it

834
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:07,460
down but the benefit of ROS 2 is
that it was is that you can at

835
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:11,060
least trim it down with ROS 1
that was just it was just on

836
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,730
tenable like you couldn't even
consider it but now you can't

837
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:17,090
like it's it's it's much more
technically possible thing to

838
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,510
build you know flight capable
control software that uses ROS 2

839
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:23,510
as a as a messaging pass as a
message passion framework

840
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:27,470
Audrow Nash: for example. And
then so you guys are migrating

841
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:32,450
your Clearpath robot, you
primarily run your ClearPath

842
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,640
robots with ROS 2 correct

843
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:37,970
Yeah all the all the
all the custom software we do is

844
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:38,660
ROS one right now

845
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,440
Audrow Nash: Is ROS 1. Any so
and you mentioned the auto where

846
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,210
you guys are using ROS 2

847
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:49,820
Ryan Gariepy: Sorry, sorry.
autoware as in the Sofer

848
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:53,480
autoware as in the community
initiative, we don't use that

849
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:57,410
what I was referring to was the
autonomous code that are auto

850
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:04,400
Ott Oh, autonomous mobile robots
use gotcha so that's like

851
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:09,920
everything there is remains you
know ROS one for the time being

852
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:15,080
I believe we have will be will
start supporting ROS 2 will

853
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,890
start supporting ROS 2 on some
research platforms in the near

854
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:22,430
future. But since I don't have
the schedule up in front of me,

855
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:25,100
I'm not going to I'm not going
to actually say those dates

856
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:31,340
because I like to support my
engineering team the the I don't

857
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,650
have a Twitter account where I
just I just randomly named

858
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:39,770
things on the on the the side of
our of our autonomy software, we

859
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:42,650
use ROS 2 for comms and we're
started we are starting to

860
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:45,470
consider the the migration
process we just finished the

861
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:48,950
Python three migration. So next
up is the ROS 1 to ROS 2

862
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:52,610
migration. But as you can
imagine, as you can imagine,

863
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:56,420
when you have several dozen and
software engineers writing code,

864
00:53:56,450 --> 00:54:00,350
and you know, in this code is
also all going out to the

865
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:04,070
factories, you we can't stop
everything and just do a

866
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:06,110
migration of, you know,

867
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:08,210
Audrow Nash: five systems
business continues

868
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:12,680
of engineering. So I've been
talking with a lot of that stuff

869
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,950
if we and of course if we find
any, you know, shortcuts along

870
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:18,290
the way we'll we'll definitely
be short sharing them with the

871
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:21,200
community because I'm sure
there's other people in our, in

872
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,190
our situation,

873
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:28,370
for sure. Are you getting
comments from customers, or

874
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,330
people that are coming to you?
Or they're asking for ROS to or

875
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,650
how's the community?

876
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:37,100
Common? Yeah, it's
becoming more and more common I

877
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:44,480
can say from I can say from
generally looking at from

878
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,620
generally looking at you know,
the interests at ROSCon there's

879
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:52,160
a lot of people developing in
ROS tooth right now. And they're

880
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,190
developing you know, very real,
very serious things in ROS two.

881
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:59,060
We're and we're definitely
getting interest with ours. You

882
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:02,450
know, for example, One of the
very things, which is ROS 2,

883
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:04,820
which is very clearly ROS 2 is
that if you are going to

884
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:09,800
interact the API to our indoor
autonomy software, for example,

885
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:13,190
which is what runs all of our
industrial self driving vehicles

886
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:16,280
or industrial mobile robots.
That's all ROS. That's, that's

887
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,120
the API. So if you want to go
and talk to one of our talk to

888
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,850
one of our autos, ROS, who is
your only option?

889
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,490
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Now, let's
see worse, I would love to talk

890
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:32,520
about some other things. But
seeing that we don't have that

891
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:37,620
much time left, if we're trying
to hit an hour, I would love to

892
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,810
ask you some kind of larger
questions and get your

893
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:46,320
perspective on a few things. So
the first, you are saying you

894
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,610
caught the wave of robotics,
really, and you guys have stayed

895
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:54,750
on top of it now. And also, it
seems to me from talking now,

896
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:57,360
you guys also caught the open
source wave, which is really

897
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,530
exciting to be on both of those,
like, just you invested in open

898
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:03,930
source and the community and the
amount of code out there. And

899
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:08,160
the quality of code is just
grown and grown. How would you?

900
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:14,010
What advice would you give to a
startup that is looking to do a

901
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:18,120
hardware robotics startup, and
they're just beginning now, and

902
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:21,570
they don't have all this
infrastructure, or expertise.

903
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:28,320
So the first, the first bit of
advice I'd give is to not is to

904
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,650
know what you want, know what
value you're bringing to the

905
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:39,390
world. And partner as much as
possible around that value. And

906
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:44,520
what that means is, when we
started our auto division, we

907
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,710
had to build the robots from
scratch, we had to build the

908
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:50,100
autonomy from scratch, the fleet
manager, the UI, all of our

909
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,890
continuous integration systems,
we did a bunch of like internal

910
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:56,310
upgrades to like gazebo to make
it fit in continuous integration

911
00:56:56,310 --> 00:57:00,690
systems. Like control software,
a lot like all of this stuff, we

912
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:05,370
did all that from scratch. But
now you can basically partner or

913
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:11,070
buy a lot of that stuff off the
shelf. And I would really

914
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:14,100
encourage any new startup in
robotics to start with that and

915
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,740
not try to build everything from
scratch, have a very good idea

916
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:20,460
of what they're bringing to the
table. And if I look at a Yeah,

917
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:23,610
if I look at the way, you know,
a typical startup, you're either

918
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:27,420
bringing a new technology to an
existing market, or you're

919
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,750
bringing a new market, or you're
you're, you're taking an

920
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:34,680
existing technology and applying
it to a new market. And so the

921
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,800
Airbnb and the Uber, for
example, like they were

922
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,370
bringing, they were, they had a
market hypothesis, and they were

923
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:43,680
bringing some some pretty
standard technology there. Like

924
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,160
at the time everyone had
smartphones. And obviously, we

925
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,060
all still have smartphones. But
us we had we had a newer

926
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,520
technology, which was being
brought to an existing market,

927
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,280
which was materials handling,
right? And I'm using the auto

928
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:06,510
example here. And the but you
want to pick one, right? So are

929
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:09,780
you. And these days, there's
just so much technology out

930
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:12,990
there. And really, I think a lot
of the opportunity is all these

931
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:19,410
new markets where you can apply
robotics. Yeah. And that means

932
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,410
not inventing the wheel along
the way. And, you know, part of

933
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:25,980
this I we spent a ton of time
earlier on in this conversation

934
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,770
talking about the ways that that
ClearPath engages with people.

935
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:31,890
So obviously we can support
those, those sorts of customers,

936
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:35,430
we've supported startups along
the way. If and, you know, what,

937
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:38,100
if if they're working with us,
and then the startup turns

938
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:41,790
around and says, You know what,
I've got an order for 1000. And

939
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:44,460
we're going to go and outsource
that stuff to let's say, jaybo,

940
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:47,190
for example, and because they're
going to give us the best deal.

941
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:49,710
Hey, that's cool. I don't I
don't have a problem with that.

942
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:52,500
Thank you. I'm glad you're
succeeding, right. But there are

943
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,500
companies like us, and then
there's all sorts of off the

944
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,680
shelf technology out there as
well, that can help you along

945
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,680
the way. So that would be the
real thing. I'd say to those new

946
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,080
robotics startups, like don't
try to do all the hardware and

947
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,060
all the autonomy and all the fee
management and all the

948
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:09,960
information that shows what you
can use what you can't like I

949
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:14,310
have I have spent those budgets.
I know how much it costs. And I

950
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:17,310
know Yeah, I know the stresses
that it brings you. And it's

951
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:20,520
it's not worth it. There's other
ways to do it. Now at least.

952
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:25,170
What do you think about this
idea as like platform as a

953
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:27,930
service or something like this
for a business model? And what I

954
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:32,700
mean by that would be, if I am a
robotics company, I'm going to

955
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:35,760
buy someone else's robot but my
own code on it, and then have it

956
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,330
do something useful. Do you
think that will be a reasonable

957
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:41,100
business model in the future

958
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:46,350
for robotics startups? Like
basically, so which are which

959
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:48,720
side is the startup honor? And
are they on this side of writing

960
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,290
the app?

961
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,080
Yes. Basically an app. Yeah,
right, I

962
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,650
think. Yeah, absolutely. I think
that's going to be I think

963
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:59,850
that's going to be the case, I
think, early on. It's going to

964
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:06,240
be combination of the app and
some tooling, not perhaps not as

965
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,060
complex as a robot, but that
you're going to get the

966
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:12,060
combination of the app and the
tooling. But I definitely think

967
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:14,370
that's going to be the case. And
we've seen this actually,

968
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:18,930
through the through the recent,
you know, year and a half, we've

969
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:22,740
seen a lot of companies with no
robotics expertise whatsoever

970
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:26,850
been able to build disinfection
applications, right. And that's

971
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:29,700
what they've done right? Is they
built a new application. They

972
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,430
built a new application. They
built some hardware, they've

973
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:36,750
stuck it on a robot, and they're
good. So yeah, it's it's huge. I

974
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:39,780
think, I think, right? I think
for now, you're going to see it

975
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:43,590
as you're not going to
necessarily see app, like just

976
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:48,570
someone who writes apps and
makes money off the app. Or was

977
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:50,670
there even the app plus tooling,
I think there's still going to

978
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:54,960
be like, app plus tooling, plus,
you know, a sales effort on its

979
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,210
own right? Like you're, if
you're selling, if you make a

980
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:59,910
disinfection robot, can you've
done the app, you've built the

981
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:02,460
hardware, and then you're going
and you're going to sell it?

982
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:05,490
Right? So I don't think we're
yet as disser meat

983
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:10,440
disintermediate disintermediated
as Apple, Apple is, for example,

984
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,920
where they also bring you the
customers. But I definitely

985
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:19,530
think that the time for getting
a robot off the shelf and just

986
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:22,260
putting like, and just talking
to its API and throwing some

987
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:26,400
tools on it. That time is now
like, I think that is now two

988
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,100
years ago, it wasn't then but
but in the last year or so I

989
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,230
think we're over that tipping
point, which is really exciting.

990
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,580
I mean, I wouldn't I there's,
you're still there's still going

991
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:39,870
to be lacking in that the caveat
there is not every space, right?

992
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:43,080
Like there's no autonomy out
there, which can take like, you

993
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:46,860
know, what, a one or two killer
robot and run it around children

994
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:50,340
safely. I think that's not an
off the shelf tool yet. But

995
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:53,100
around a factory around a mine.
Now you can do that right now.

996
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,340
That's awesome. So you're saying
like two years ago, it wasn't

997
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:02,760
the case that we could do this?
Now? It seems to be good. Where

998
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:07,350
do you think it's going kind of
projecting out? Say the next two

999
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:10,410
years, next five years, 10
years, whatever it might be?

1000
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,880
Where do you think the community
is going?

1001
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:18,060
Well, I think in general, I
mean, I think in general, it's

1002
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:20,220
this is funny, because I
actually asked a very similar

1003
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,070
question, when I interview
people, for for jobs at our

1004
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:28,350
company send out the tables have
turned, I think, I think in two

1005
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:32,550
years, we're definitely gonna
see areas specific markets, like

1006
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,980
us ours, for example, factories,
where putting robots in, or

1007
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:41,370
mobile robots and, or
collaborative robots in is going

1008
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:45,840
to be a pure business decision.
We have already seen this now,

1009
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:48,630
where people have stopped asking
us to prove that the

1010
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:51,600
localization is going to work,
for example, right? Like we

1011
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:55,290
either say localization works,
and it does, or we say that it's

1012
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:57,450
probably not going to work, and
we won't sell them, or we won't

1013
01:02:57,510 --> 01:03:00,840
try to sell it, right. Like
that's, but more and more, it's

1014
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:09,390
going to be the same calculation
of always, it's just like, it's

1015
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:12,330
just gonna be a business
decision, right? Like, robots

1016
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:15,030
are just something that I buy
off the shelf. just purely

1017
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:18,480
pragmatic, which to a lesser
extent, it's kind of that way

1018
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,720
with robot arms still. But in
both cases, the other thing that

1019
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,720
makes that possible, is the
significant decrease in

1020
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:29,040
integration time. And cost. And
robot arms will still have a

1021
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:33,300
little bit of a challenge there,
although many companies are

1022
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:39,690
starting to are starting to work
around that. But you're going to

1023
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:42,210
see very low integration times.
And because of that, it's going

1024
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:45,750
to be a lot more commodity like
to just put some robots out in

1025
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:49,560
the out in the world. Five
years, I mean, five years, I

1026
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,470
think we're really going to
start to see robots in earnest

1027
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:55,650
within the general public.
Again, maybe not, you know,

1028
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:59,520
maybe not in the daycare, but
you are going to see them out in

1029
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,190
earnest in the general public
doing useful things. So I don't

1030
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:04,980
mean in science fair projects, I
don't mean little things like

1031
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:08,130
that. And I know that there are
various trials, there are

1032
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:12,000
various trials of delivery
robots and things like this, but

1033
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,270
I think it'll be a there'll be
much more pervasive, much, much

1034
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:21,990
more pervasive. And we will be
able to say that in certain

1035
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:25,770
cases, and probably not on road
self driving, sorry to say, but

1036
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:30,030
concerning cases, the safety
story is effectively salt, I

1037
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:34,140
think we'll be able to say that.
And when you're there, you know,

1038
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:36,960
what that means is over that,
that two to five year timeframe.

1039
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:41,550
That's where the real app like
that, you know, the ecosystem

1040
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:45,030
becomes really powerful. Because
you know, now we're at the point

1041
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:47,670
where you can write apps for our
robots in a factory right now.

1042
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:50,280
But first, you need to get into
the factory, but you can write

1043
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:54,090
it right now. And but now, you
know, two years, five years from

1044
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:57,480
now, they're really going to be
in front of everybody. So you'll

1045
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,780
be able to script against one of
those robots. As as much as

1046
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:05,160
everything else, and maybe what
I'll say is people might look at

1047
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,620
this and say, Well, you know,
why are we saying this now?

1048
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:10,440
Right? Like, didn't people say
this 10 years ago and 20 years

1049
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,360
ago, whatever it like,
absolutely, they did, right.

1050
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:17,640
Like there was a glut of robot
App Store companies. You know,

1051
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,300
eight years ago, nine years ago,
roughly, around the time of the

1052
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:24,090
turtlebot, one launch. And then
there was, you know, Microsoft

1053
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:26,820
heavily invested in robotics
with Microsoft robotic studio.

1054
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:31,230
And that was, that was a 2000s.
I think that was, but one of the

1055
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:35,880
things that's happening now is
that all of those apps couldn't

1056
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:41,430
rely on safe, reliable autonomy.
And then, and sort of think

1057
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:42,690
about his assault

1058
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,360
kind of thing. That's the that's
the bad word, right? Like,

1059
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:50,100
yeah, you couldn't you couldn't,
you need to have a target, which

1060
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:56,160
is useful, like a device target,
which is useful. And now, that

1061
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,870
didn't used to be the case,
right? Like when these app

1062
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,720
stores started, started up,
you're just kind of assuming

1063
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,630
that a bunch of people on their
own, we're each going to come up

1064
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:07,320
with safe, reliable autonomy.
And that's, that's hard when

1065
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:10,890
you're moving, you know,
hundreds of kilos around. But

1066
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:13,530
now now, no, I think we're in a
much better place like that

1067
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:17,850
autonomy is well, I have, you
know, many million reasons,

1068
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:22,590
million hours of operation to
say that this is possible,

1069
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:22,920
right?

1070
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:31,560
Hmm. That is exciting. So
wrapping up, do you have any? Do

1071
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:35,520
you have a Twitter or how can
people find you or any any

1072
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,310
public links, you'd like to
share anything?

1073
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:43,830
They can find me on LinkedIn? I
unfortunately, do not. I am not

1074
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:47,340
part of the the Twitter,
whatever, whatever, whatever

1075
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,290
it's being called. But yeah, I'm
not on Twitter. I'm not on

1076
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:53,160
Instagram, but they can find me
on LinkedIn. And in my email,

1077
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:56,820
which which will be needed to
connect is Ryan at clear

1078
01:06:56,820 --> 01:07:00,690
path.ai. So they can also find
me on that email. But LinkedIn

1079
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:01,740
would be preferred, I believe.

1080
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:05,010
Awesome. Okay, I've enjoyed
this. Thank you.

1081
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:07,260
Thank you very much.

1082
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:13,080
That's all we have for you
today. I enjoyed Ryan's answer

1083
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:16,860
to where thinks robotics will be
in two to five years. Where do

1084
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:19,380
you think robotics will be in
two to five years? Let us know

1085
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:23,910
in the comments on sensing
gackt.com or discourse. Thank

1086
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:26,700
you again to Open Robotics for
being our founding sponsor.

1087
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:27,780
Bye, everyone.
