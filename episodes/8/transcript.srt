00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,140
Audrow Nash: This is a
conversation with Disha Sarawgi

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,630
and Mohammed Kabir. Disha and
Kabir both work at Corvus

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,490
Robotics. Disha is the head of
Special Projects and an early

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,200
employee at Corvus, while Kabir
is a co founder and the CTO at

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,330
Corvus. Corvus robotics is a
Boston based startup that makes

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,450
a drone to fly around warehouses
and help with inventory

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,620
management. Their drone, the
Corvus one seems to promise to

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,860
reduce inventory loss in
warehouses, which currently

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,100
happens to a staggering rate. As
you'll find out in the

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,210
interview, they speak about
flying their drone in warehouses

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,070
working with customers, safety,
fleet management, how Corvus is

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,810
funded, and they give advice to
aspiring entrepreneurs. This is

13
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,190
the Sense Think Act Podcast. I'm
Audrow Nash. Thank you to our

14
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,630
founding sponsor Open Robotics.
And here is my conversation with

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,850
Disha and Kabir.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,340
Kabir, would you introduce
yourself?

17
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,540
Mohammed Kabir: Yeah, sure. So
I'm Kabir. I'm the I'm the co

18
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,270
founder and CTO of Corvis
robotics.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,970
Audrow Nash: Hi, Disha.

20
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,070
Disha Sarawgi: Hi, I'm Disha. I
work as head of Special Projects

21
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,150
and General Projects.

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,340
I lead basically all the product
lines here at Corvus.

23
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,110
Mohammed Kabir: And she's also
one of our early employees, one

24
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,280
of the very first

25
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,490
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. How large
are you guys now?

26
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,630
Disha Sarawgi: We do have about
15 people across engineering and

27
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,710
on engineering goes

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,460
Audrow Nash: to the shot when
what number employee were you?

29
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,150
Disha Sarawgi: I read? Second,
probably.

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,470
Audrow Nash: Yeah. She's the
second employee. Right after you

31
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:01,890
come here.

32
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,180
Mohammed Kabir: The co founder,
the founders,

33
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:12,570
Audrow Nash: I see. So tell me
about Corvus. Yeah, about what

34
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,000
is the mission and everything.

35
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,550
Mohammed Kabir: Yeah, sure. So
when we started out, sometime in

36
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,640
2017, or so we saw this a whole
bunch of robotics companies,

37
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,290
newly formed robotics companies,
really kind of doing great

38
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,030
things in the warehouse and
industrial automation space. And

39
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,030
generally, my background is that
I come from a real robots. So I

40
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,570
really love flying things and
making drones. So when we

41
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,960
started the company, we kind of
were like looking for use cases,

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,890
which we could automate kind of
putting together this industrial

43
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,120
automation space, and aerial
robotics. And I think we found a

44
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,100
pretty good niche and decided to
pursue it, which is warehouse

45
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,240
inventory management. That's
kind of our singular, large

46
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,950
focus throughout the company. So
all our product lines are kind

47
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,770
of trying to solve for that one
specific thing, which is

48
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,210
warehouse inventory. And that's
where the idea for purpose one

49
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,920
was born. What purpose one is,
it's a drone, which which does,

50
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,690
which helps warehouses do
inventory. This is a huge

51
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,070
market, warehouses lose millions
and billions of dollars worth of

52
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,490
goods from inside their own
facilities every year. And this

53
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,050
is the problem we set out to
solve.

54
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,319
Audrow Nash: Why is that? Why
are they losing millions and

55
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,269
billions of dollars? Right,
good, right.

56
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,720
Mohammed Kabir: So the way
warehouses do inventory

57
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,490
management today is whenever
they send a person out with like

58
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,490
a handheld barcode scanner, and
then this person goes up and

59
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,100
down the racks. So these are
huge facilities that can be

60
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,920
millions of square feet. So this
person goes up and down the

61
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,270
racks with this handheld barcode
scanner, and basically scans

62
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,960
barcodes on the on whatever
stuff they have on the shelves.

63
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,160
And then they basically write
down or somehow tie back into

64
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,850
their warehouse management
system where this thing was. Now

65
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,210
in variably, because there's a
human involved in the loop. This

66
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:22,950
introduces a lot of errors. And
typically, I think the

67
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,940
nationwide average for kind of
the inventory accuracy across

68
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,200
warehouses in the US, it's
something about 40 to 60%, which

69
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,560
is actually quite bad. So they
lose half of their stuff just

70
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,210
because they don't know where
they put it. How could

71
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:44,220
Audrow Nash: that be that they
lose 42 They only retain 46 to

72
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,910
60%. Yeah. So so what happens is
like, why why are these red? Why

73
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,530
such a large number of loss?

74
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,670
Mohammed Kabir: Right? So um,
basically, the way inventory

75
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,000
comes into warehouses, you
basically unload from trucks and

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,620
Then there is a person who is
taking it from these truck bays

77
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,430
and then putting it in their
shelf somewhere. And this person

78
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,510
is responsible for kind of doing
an incremental scan. So they

79
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,370
can. So basically, we can input
into their warehouse management

80
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,610
system, where this particular
thing was booked. So it's

81
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,110
basically all deltas. So it's,
it's as things coming.

82
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,900
Audrow Nash: What do you mean,
deltas? It's, it's every, it's

83
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,430
the change effectively?

84
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,190
Mohammed Kabir: Yes, yes, it is
the change. So every time

85
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,860
there's a change, they update
their warehouse management

86
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,420
system, but invariably, because
there isn't like a global view

87
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,900
of the warehouse, per se. Errors
build up over time.

88
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,850
Audrow Nash: Why? Why are
they're building up, though? I

89
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,810
mean, if I just put something
there and leave it there, it

90
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,360
should stay there. And it
shouldn't matter that I only

91
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,850
have Delta's what's going on?
Are people stealing some of the

92
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,170
packages that people move?
Knowing or like, what's creating

93
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,700
60% of the law?

94
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:09,449
Mohammed Kabir: So I think it's
a bunch of human factors at the

95
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,109
end of the day, I wouldn't say
that stealing is a big one. But

96
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:16,589
I'm sure it is an actual
problem. One of the main things

97
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:21,089
we've seen is people just put it
in the wrong place in the first

98
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,789
place. So basically, you say
that you're putting it in

99
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:28,379
whatever aisle a slot B, but
then you put it in aisle a slot,

100
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:34,349
see the one next to it? And they
just don't care about where they

101
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:35,099
put it at the end of the

102
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,660
Audrow Nash: day? Because you
mean the person who puts it

103
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,610
there? Like, yeah, doesn't
matter.

104
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,359
Mohammed Kabir: Yeah, they're
processing like 1000s of orders

105
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:46,619
a day. So it's really hard at
even at the human level to kind

106
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:49,229
of keep up that 100% accuracy.

107
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,840
Audrow Nash: I mean, it seems
like getting one and two wrong

108
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,320
if you're getting that level of
like loss, which is kind of

109
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,450
nuts. Yeah. Yeah.

110
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,180
Mohammed Kabir: It's a huge
problem. It sounds ridiculous,

111
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,350
but it is what it is. And that's
that's what we set out to solve.

112
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,060
Audrow Nash: So then, what your
so tell me a bit about how

113
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,540
you're solving it with your
Corvus one, drone.

114
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,190
Mohammed Kabir: Sure. So what
premise one is, it's basically a

115
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:23,190
full cycle autonomous solution.
It's a drone, and this charging

116
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,250
dock, which we go and install in
facilities. So it sits at the

117
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:31,590
end of warehouse racks. And it
does scheduled flights on its

118
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,940
own, and then goes out into the
aisles, scans inventory as it's

119
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:42,150
flying, it finds barcode scans
them comes back home lands, and

120
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,210
then we process this data and
then send it to the customer,

121
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,110
usually through some sort of
digital data dump. And what this

122
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,070
does is we're basically taking
that person who was doing this

123
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,770
with a barcode scanner, and we
put the barcode scanner on the

124
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:00,720
ground. And then we can do this
repeatedly because well, it's a

125
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,340
drone day don't get tired.

126
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,480
Audrow Nash: Yeah, so you're
thinking of this. So if you were

127
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,600
thinking of the diff, so it's
kind of like in edge detection,

128
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,960
and image or something like
this. So you only get like, I

129
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,300
don't know, you're only getting
the difference, it's not a very

130
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,560
clear way to see the whole state
of the warehouse, right. And so

131
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,040
now what you're saying is your
drone flies around periodically.

132
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,000
And so you can kind of get
updates over time of where all

133
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,010
the packages are. Exactly.

134
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,200
Mohammed Kabir: And if you do
this frequently enough, we can

135
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,230
basically get that global view
of the warehouse basically every

136
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,830
day, depending on the size of
the facility. Okay.

137
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:47,039
Disha Sarawgi: Yeah, generally,
like do I do that? Generally,

138
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,869
inventory counts are taken by
houses maybe once a year. But

139
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:56,339
with the drawing, we're able to
get the entire inventory counts

140
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:02,159
multiple times. So God gives you
a great idea of like

141
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,429
historically, timestamps data,
which you can go back to and

142
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:09,329
refer to when like locate every
item at the warehouse at any

143
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:09,929
instant.

144
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:16,889
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Very
interesting. Now, how I'm

145
00:09:16,979 --> 00:09:21,599
thinking about this crazy loss.
that puzzles me honestly, that

146
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:24,449
it's so large, and I imagine
like goods are twice as

147
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:27,539
expensive as they would be if
they didn't have this loss. Is

148
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:30,749
that true? Would you think?
Like, that's probably included

149
00:09:30,749 --> 00:09:32,579
in the cost of things? Yeah.

150
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,280
Mohammed Kabir: So the way the
business model for warehouses

151
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,270
work is they just write this
loss off. So they account for

152
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,850
that loss as they're moving
stuff around.

153
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,980
Audrow Nash: Write it off in
what way

154
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:46,199
Mohammed Kabir: as just lost.

155
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,560
Audrow Nash: Okay, but yeah, but
it's

156
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,659
Mohammed Kabir: still in their
facility somewhere. It's they

157
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:52,649
just don't know where.

158
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:59,219
Audrow Nash: Hmm. Interesting.
So that with the perspective of

159
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:04,499
fraud, flying The drone around,
often, you can kind of get a

160
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:08,969
better sense doesn't require the
human to place the package as

161
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:13,529
accurately or in the specific
section so you can manage it, or

162
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:15,689
at least in the one that they
say it's placed in, because I

163
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:21,629
would imagine, it would be the
reason for the error. So then

164
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:26,819
from that, you can kind of see
if things are missing, or like

165
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:30,239
if it was here, and now it's not
you at least have a small window

166
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:34,709
of time to investigate where it
has gone to, or where, or

167
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:36,299
something like that. Yeah,

168
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,340
Disha Sarawgi: it's not always
just miss loading of items, but

169
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:46,140
sometimes, because the humans in
the loop, people also forget to

170
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,740
just scan because they're taking
care of 1000s of orders a day.

171
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:55,830
And it's, it's easy if you're
also on the ground level, but

172
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:02,100
warehouse racks go up to like 20
feet, or 20 to 30 feet. And

173
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,580
getting up a forklift scanning,
and then coming down going to

174
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,020
the next track at the same
height is not an easy feat. So

175
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,740
human error does play a big part
of this as well.

176
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:17,429
Audrow Nash: I see. Yeah, that's
a good point that they're so

177
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:21,329
high that these packages are
just stored with layer on layer

178
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:26,519
on layer of packages. Is that
the motivation for the drone?

179
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,260
Disha Sarawgi: Oh, badly. Yes.
It's like humans can do

180
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,070
inventory tracking at ground
level, probably at the same

181
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:42,960
rate. But as the height
increases, the complexity

182
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,550
increases. And that's where the
drone comes in. And we get a

183
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,620
Audrow Nash: diversity increase,
because you have to have some

184
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,800
sort of ID or something to lift
the person and you need a person

185
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,970
Manning, or thing that tries and
holds the basket. I'm picturing

186
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,690
one of those like, things that
they put up power lines, or go

187
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,960
and work on the power lines
with, I don't know how,

188
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,410
Mohammed Kabir: yeah, it's
actually quite close. So they

189
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,190
have forklifts or bucket trucks.
And basically, there's a person

190
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,880
in a harness clip to that. And
then they go up in that, and

191
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,760
they're running the barcode
scanner. And it's, it's actually

192
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,970
quite dangerous. Yeah, it is
quite terrifying. Like, we've

193
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,930
we've been in them just to get a
feel for what it's like, do this

194
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,810
annually. And it's more or less
and were

195
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,990
Audrow Nash: lifted by Yes, yes.
That's awesome. I like that. You

196
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:38,070
guys do that? Yeah. How was it
terrifying? It's it's, I'm just

197
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,480
imagining, like dangling trying
to scan packages. That sounds

198
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,350
incredibly difficult. Yeah.
Okay. So, being a drone really

199
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,920
helps you get to those high
packages very easy, it's almost

200
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,200
free, because you just have to
pilot it. Is there other other

201
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,400
advantages to having a drone,
rather than like a robot with

202
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,390
like a real big telescoping
pole, or something like this?

203
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,410
Right. So

204
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,900
Mohammed Kabir: we've, when we
started, we've actually looked

205
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,630
into all of the options.
Starting from like a lower

206
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,390
complexity, like ground robot is
obviously easier to build,

207
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:20,100
right? Because it's not flying.
But it turns out that when you

208
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,640
get your poll 20 feet high, it
becomes really hard to make the

209
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:29,220
robot not tip over, just from
the weight of the ball. And then

210
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,460
if you want to kind of conquer
that you need to make your robot

211
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,400
like the you need the size of
the base, you need to put in

212
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,000
more batteries more weight. And
it's like it's a pretty bad

213
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,490
trade off at the end of the day,
if you want to do anything of

214
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,090
that kind.

215
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,759
Audrow Nash: Okay, yeah. And
then so you basically with the

216
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:53,039
drone, the Corvis. One, you have
the drone flying and it has

217
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:56,909
effectively a barcode scanner
attached to it. And it's just

218
00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:01,079
pointing that at the packages.
Is that right? Yes, exactly. And

219
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,799
so now it's flying around from
package to package just scanning

220
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:11,969
all the different visible
barcodes? Exactly. Hmm. Okay. So

221
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:17,609
that's very interesting. How,
how far into how many systems

222
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:22,499
are deployed? And like, where
are you guys at in terms of

223
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:25,799
deploying yours to different
warehouses your system to

224
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,759
different warehouses?

225
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,700
Mohammed Kabir: Right. So we
have a bunch of customers, we

226
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,320
don't publish the exact number
on systems deployed. But it is

227
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,890
significant enough that we're
getting very interesting fleet

228
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,970
insights from them.

229
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,740
Audrow Nash: So order of
magnitude is like 10 100. It's

230
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,330
on the order of 100. Yes, that's
really exciting. 100 robots out

231
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,890
there. 100. Warehouses,

232
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,630
Mohammed Kabir: 100 vehicles.
Yeah.

233
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,279
Audrow Nash: And when you say
fleet, insights into fleet

234
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:03,149
management, you're meaning
multiple Have your drone systems

235
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:08,069
in a single warehouse? And how
to like urgently go about

236
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:15,869
scanning them? Yep. Yeah.
Gotcha. That's tell me a bit

237
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:19,259
about that. The different things
you're realizing at a fleet

238
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:22,469
level of controlling your
drones? Sure.

239
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,370
Mohammed Kabir: Let's see. So in
general, the way we design our

240
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,360
system, it's quite scalable. So
if you want to scale to a larger

241
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,570
facility, we can just add
systems basically. And they talk

242
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,450
to each other, the charging
docks can talk to each other and

243
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,680
kind of coordinate. And one of
the things we're just starting

244
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,180
to roll out is basically this
orchestration engine, which has

245
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,850
a global view of the entire
warehouse, and then it can

246
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,500
basically automatically tasked
groans to go and scan certain

247
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,150
parks either. Maybe it's a high
traffic area, which we are kind

248
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,910
of inferring from previous
flights, that if there's a lot

249
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,410
of change, and we can see that
in the data, we can, we can cast

250
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,180
more drones to kind of focus on
that one area, and things like

251
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:12,570
that.

252
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,220
Audrow Nash: That's really cool.
Yeah, you should do anything to

253
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,550
add

254
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,870
Disha Sarawgi: a bottle. Now, we
also give kind of a high level

255
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:27,570
control to the people at the
warehouse as well. We have

256
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:33,120
scheduling online, where,
whereas managers can schedule,

257
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:38,430
what time they want to draw to
go and scan what location, so

258
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,600
and then the charging of
orchestration figures out which

259
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,740
John was done there, and
autonomically does all the

260
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,660
missions and comes back and
charges again.

261
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,110
Audrow Nash: So that scheduling
that you mentioned, Keisha, it's

262
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,170
like you try to avoid when
people are in the area, or what

263
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,780
kind of why would I want to
schedule the flights of these

264
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,350
drones.

265
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:07,949
Disha Sarawgi: So there are
times in the warehouse where

266
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:13,709
there's too much traffic in an
area, and you'd rather dedicate

267
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:17,279
the drawing to less traffic
area, the friendships during the

268
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,719
day, were like, probably night
shifts have X number of people

269
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:26,369
around, and you want to get a
scan of whatever was moved

270
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:31,229
during the day. And that works
out better for people. So we

271
00:17:31,229 --> 00:17:35,279
give customers that level of
control to decide what and how

272
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:36,929
they want to use this product as
well.

273
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,760
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. And could
be are that what you mentioned

274
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,320
for it, recognizing high traffic
areas that have a lot of change

275
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,370
and trying to do them? Or I was
imagining? Just I didn't

276
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,280
understand what about the fleet
management was extremely

277
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,160
interesting before because it
was like, Oh, you just patrol

278
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,940
certain regions. But then if a
certain region has a lot more

279
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,340
change, you want to make more
passes of it, because you want

280
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,450
to hire more temporal data.
That's very interesting. Yeah.

281
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,390
Gotcha. How so now that you have
100 robots out there or so like,

282
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,970
order of magnitude? How is this
affecting? Package loss?

283
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,780
Mohammed Kabir: Right, right.
Right. So one of the things

284
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,880
we've begun seeing is that we've
actually been able to increase

285
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,780
the inventory accuracy for
warehouses significantly. It

286
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,530
really depends on a per facility
level, how much we can help just

287
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:39,150
because facility dynamics, the
workers, their, their existing

288
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,500
practices. We don't have any
specific numbers, which we want

289
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,710
to share this point, just
because it's extremely facility

290
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,400
specific. And even like any
vague ballpark number idea will

291
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,170
be wrong. So

292
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,110
Audrow Nash: you can have a
specific instance of the thing.

293
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,950
Yeah, but I mean, maybe you have
like an average, or something or

294
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,040
like a median level of
improvement. Right. So

295
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,480
Mohammed Kabir: like, I'd be
interested in,

296
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:08,099
Audrow Nash: like, double it,
because the huge, like 60% loss

297
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:12,419
is crazy to me. And if you keep
an additional 30%, that would be

298
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:16,229
amazing. I just walk

299
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,160
Mohammed Kabir: across, right,
yeah, that is actually quite

300
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,180
close to what we almost
guarantee that if your facility

301
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,770
is using Corvis drones 95% Just
kind of the baseline you can

302
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:35,130
expect to achieve within months.
Yeah, and this involves working

303
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,770
really closely with every
customer because again, as I

304
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,890
said, every facility is
different. Everyone uses

305
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,880
different barcodes. There's
there's a lot of moving pieces

306
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,270
there.

307
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,480
Audrow Nash: See? So let's see,
can you tell me a bit about

308
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,070
working with these customers?

309
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:57,900
Mohammed Kabir: Um,

310
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,510
Audrow Nash: and maybe the chef
you have a perspective On this,

311
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,760
I want to try to get us all
talking about the same amount.

312
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,420
Disha Sarawgi: Sure, so, okay,
since the team is pretty small

313
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,420
right now, like, we are the ones
who actually go to the

314
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:18,090
deployment as well. And it's
good to have engineers on site

315
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,710
as well. Because if we build
products that people cannot use

316
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,360
in production, that it makes no
sense. So going on site

317
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,830
interacting with customers, we
get a sense of what they want,

318
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:38,010
and we build accordingly. So
like onside, Devon been

319
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,510
instances where customers have
told us stories, like they spent

320
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,710
hours on a Sunday night trying
to locate one package, which was

321
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:52,110
lost. And that's why like, and
if there was something on

322
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:55,380
Sunday, that sets them back for
the rest of the week, because

323
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,630
their week starts on Sunday. And
that's where our drones have

324
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:05,670
been able to get them a good
amount of improvement like that

325
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:10,260
is we have all the data stored.
And we can tell them exactly

326
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,940
where, what, where what package
was seen. And it has them

327
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,090
significantly improved their
buffers and dedicated with

328
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:23,280
others still actually getting
packages to avoid. So

329
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,970
Audrow Nash: that's cool. So
does this mean that you have to

330
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,900
tie the data that you guys
collect into their existing

331
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,860
package, localization
infrastructure, so like figuring

332
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,160
out where all the packages are,
and the map of that I imagine

333
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,700
it's like a grid or something
like a two 3d grid where they

334
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,410
say it's in here, or at this
location on this shelf, and you

335
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,400
have to like, locate the
package, and then map it to how

336
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,430
they actually represent the
location of the package. Is that

337
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,730
true?

338
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,120
Disha Sarawgi: Oh, yes. So every
facility has their own warehouse

339
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,610
management system, which is,
like, where every location is

340
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:07,500
tagged as, depending on the
rack. And it's not.

341
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,000
Audrow Nash: So it's like a
sticker is on the so say, we

342
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,990
have three shelves or something
high, that each shelf of those

343
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,890
will have a sticker or something
that says this is shelf one,

344
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,980
this is shelf two, this is shelf
three. Yeah. And so that's how

345
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,850
you localize them.

346
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:29,009
Disha Sarawgi: Yeah. So it also
is like, maybe a number as to

347
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:33,029
their eyes than their faces,
like the two faces on each eye.

348
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:37,229
So then, the next level is the
face. And then they go by the

349
00:22:37,229 --> 00:22:41,579
level of the rag. And then each
level also has number of slots.

350
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:47,249
So the a hierarchical naming of
each pallet position in the

351
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:51,239
warehouse, which to keep track
of and the warehouse management

352
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:57,389
system. And we use the same
mapping, and we work with

353
00:22:57,389 --> 00:23:01,469
customers to integrate the data
we collect into their management

354
00:23:01,469 --> 00:23:02,309
systems as well.

355
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,029
Audrow Nash: So it's a big key
value problem effectively with

356
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:10,079
the key being the label of the
shelf, and then the value being

357
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:15,749
whatever packages are on it kind
of thing. That's when I guess so

358
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:20,069
if that's the case, it might not
be I basically, was it

359
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:24,029
challenging to kind of work with
all of the different warehouse

360
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,269
management setups that all of
the different warehouses have?

361
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,129
Or was there a challenge there?

362
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,700
Disha Sarawgi: Oh, okay. Kobe,
do you want it?

363
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,570
Mohammed Kabir: Sure, yeah. This
is just a huge pain generally

364
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,910
integrating with the consuming,
but the number of different

365
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:46,710
systems out in the wild. We have
a couple of ways of integrating

366
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,430
life from the very simplest
version, which we can basically

367
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,180
support for everyone is we just
give them a digital data dump.

368
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,110
It's something like a CSV or
something of that kind, which

369
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:02,940
they can. And everyone says,
yes, yes, yes, men is in

370
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,270
commerce,

371
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,480
Audrow Nash: it can be processed
like an Excel sheet. Exactly.

372
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,530
It's like it's essentially an
Excel sheet. Yeah. And then.

373
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,300
Mohammed Kabir: And then we can
also kind of go into slightly

374
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,330
more advanced integrations where
we have some API which they can

375
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,200
pull for data, or we can go the
other way, and we can push data

376
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,560
to their API's. This is again,
very facility specific, very

377
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,860
customer specific, and it's
essentially a custom integration

378
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,150
for every new facility.

379
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:35,219
Disha Sarawgi: We want to give
as much value to the customers

380
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:40,799
as we can, so we try to
integrate with whatever their

381
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,999
existing processes are and make
them make it as easy as we can.

382
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,200
Audrow Nash: See, so now,
getting into your drone a little

383
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:58,440
bit more. How I like just how
large is it? It has the

384
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,080
autonomous charging dock just
telling you bit about a bit more

385
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,420
about it. What sensors it has,
what it how large what it looks

386
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:11,100
like, everything should start.

387
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,320
Disha Sarawgi: Sure. Yeah, I'm
good tone is about.

388
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,780
Audrow Nash: And this is a
cordless one we're talking

389
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,540
about. Correct? Great. Yeah.
Yeah.

390
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,920
Disha Sarawgi: So it's basically
two components. We have the

391
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,650
landing pad, which is the
charging dock for us. And the

392
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:37,260
drone. The charging station is
about like, one meter or 2.7

393
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:46,380
meters, maybe. And the drawn is
probably, like 3.4. Yeah, five

394
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,320
Mohammed Kabir: meters in
diameter.

395
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,880
Audrow Nash: Okay, so for now,
just kind of, yes, landing

396
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,870
station is four feet or five
feet, like a square kind of

397
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,940
thing. And I saw it in a video.
And I don't know if it's

398
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,990
changed, but it's like a
fiducial marker, like a QR tag.

399
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,900
And then you have the charging
dock in the middle of it. So I'm

400
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,040
assuming that you're counting
that in the five foot width of

401
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:19,650
the station? Yes, yeah. Okay.
Yeah, go ahead.

402
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,560
Disha Sarawgi: So these are the
mountains at a height where

403
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:27,540
forklift can go through
underneath it, and we're not

404
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,080
causing any obstruction to
general warehouse traffic.

405
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,509
Audrow Nash: How did you What
was the lesson learned for why

406
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:39,179
you are mounting on the Bub
forklifts? I assume that was

407
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,489
like, there's some story there.

408
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:48,629
Disha Sarawgi: So yeah, like, we
genuinely love the landing pad

409
00:26:48,629 --> 00:26:55,349
and the drawn to like at the end
of a warehouse racks. And there

410
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:58,979
is also a high traffic area for
anybody who wants to go into the

411
00:26:58,979 --> 00:27:04,379
aisle or come out of the aisle.
And we do not want to cause any

412
00:27:04,379 --> 00:27:07,259
obstruction for them to take
like a large radius around the

413
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:11,909
racks. Because some of them are
also narrow passages, which is

414
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:16,109
difficult to get through. So we
generally mount them at a height

415
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:22,739
where the drone can also operate
without obstructing the traffic

416
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:23,489
underneath it.

417
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,240
Audrow Nash: Did like a get run
over or where people just

418
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,210
frustrated that it was like a
long path around or

419
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,050
Mohammed Kabir: so we've had
some close calls before before

420
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,990
we kind of realized that we
should move it up even higher.

421
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,040
So one of the things about
forklifts is that they kind of

422
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,950
have two modes of operation. So
one is when they're just

423
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,040
traveling along the ground, and
therefore service fully at

424
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,490
ground level. And there's
another thing where if you have

425
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,310
to take packages off from a
higher act, they basically

426
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,920
extend up and then the whole
thing goes up in the forks also

427
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:04,440
go up with it. Now what happens
is, even though forklift drivers

428
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,060
instructed to not move around at
full extension,

429
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:12,749
Audrow Nash: sometimes even
meaning the fork all the way up

430
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:13,529
the exact right.

431
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,650
Mohammed Kabir: Yes, that is
correct. So they're never

432
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,080
supposed to actually be moving
around about the whole thing

433
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,660
extended in the forks all the
way up, because as you can

434
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,700
imagine, that's pretty
dangerous. stuff. Exactly. And

435
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:32,760
but it's actually it does happen
sometimes. And then well, as you

436
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,900
can imagine, they could hit our
landing pad or they could hit

437
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,020
other stuff. Um, that is why we
tried to position it at such a

438
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,660
place which minimizes any

439
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,590
Audrow Nash: of this kind. So
it's kind of you have like a

440
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:52,140
shelf side and then a few feet
up, you'll have your actual

441
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,580
landing pad, which is five foot
by five foot, approximately one

442
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,050
point So would you say seven
meter

443
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,970
Disha Sarawgi: square? Oh,

444
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,930
Mohammed Kabir: point 1.2 by
point seven. It's yeah,

445
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:07,049
Audrow Nash: yeah. Okay, so some
square that suspended up there,

446
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:11,069
like a little bird's nest. Yeah.
And that that has the charging

447
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:18,239
station there. You're Corvus one
drone. Does it have like guards

448
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:22,679
around the propellers? Or like
how is it set up? So it's a

449
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:27,659
quadrotor. It has four rotors.
And each of those rotors has a

450
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:31,169
propeller spinning. That's how
it lifts up. Do the propellers

451
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:35,069
have guards around them? So that
they don't like hit anything? Or

452
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:37,229
is it not a problem?

453
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,630
Mohammed Kabir: That actually,
there's a story behind that too.

454
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,440
So probably the story around
Yes, indeed. Indeed. So when we

455
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,340
started we actually did used to
have propeller guards around the

456
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,900
propellers. But after like doing
1000s of flights, one of the

457
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:02,670
things we realized was that If
there is any kind of collision

458
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,180
with anything, the propeller
guards don't really help in the

459
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,560
first place, they actually end
up. So the reason they don't

460
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,790
help is whatever material you
build your propeller guards out

461
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:20,430
of, they typically have some
amount of flex to them. And what

462
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:23,820
can happen is your propeller
guard can kind of bend and hit

463
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,960
your propellers instead. And
that's kind of a no win

464
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,900
situation for everyone. Because
then the drone, there's like a

465
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,980
catastrophic failure.

466
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,540
Audrow Nash: Just falls down.
Yeah, pretty much smashes on the

467
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,550
warehouse floor. Okay, pretty
much.

468
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,360
Mohammed Kabir: So the way we
started looking at the problem

469
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,700
was how can we prevent any kind
of a situation where there could

470
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,350
be a collision in the first
place. And kind of what we've

471
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,910
converged through is our economy
stack maintains this safety

472
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,410
envelope around the vehicle. And
we basically got rid of the the

473
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:04,350
hardware prop guards, and the
software makes sure that the

474
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,500
drone is just never close enough
to get into any situation of

475
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,130
that kind.

476
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,760
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Okay, so
you found basically, you could

477
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,670
just stay far enough away from
everything so that you don't

478
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,340
need pretty much any sort of
propeller guards and the

479
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,770
propeller guards weren't even
that good, because they flex and

480
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,720
they would just go into the
propeller, and then it would

481
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,260
crash. So they'd be like, for
protecting fingers or something

482
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,350
where I would stop it. And I
would hit the propeller guard,

483
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,290
but then the propeller would hit
the propeller guard, and then it

484
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:35,700
would fall. So my fingers would
be okay, but the drone would

485
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:41,430
still suffer the same color. I
don't know falling from air. Why

486
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,760
not just use really rigid? I
guess. So you've eliminated the

487
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,360
need for it. I just wonder about
like, really rigid propeller.

488
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,210
But maybe they're heavier, they
reduce your flight time or

489
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,050
exactly. Yeah,

490
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,010
Mohammed Kabir: that's, that's
pretty much it. If you're going

491
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:59,640
to design with propeller guards
in mind, you need to kind of add

492
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,730
a lot of extra weight to the
vehicle, which might be

493
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,210
acceptable for for certain
companies, or certain people

494
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:11,730
working on drones. But for us,
as since we kind of designed

495
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,520
around the problem, it just was
never a thing.

496
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:21,689
Audrow Nash: Yeah. And then the
shot. Can you speak a little bit

497
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,479
to the are you doing something
with the cable?

498
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,129
Disha Sarawgi: No, I was
blogging?

499
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:31,680
Audrow Nash: Ah, yes. Yeah,
these lame to have the computer

500
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:36,570
turn off. Can you speak a little
bit to like safety concerns of

501
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,700
customers? Because I guess I'm
getting at what I'm getting at

502
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,510
with the propeller guards. Is I
wonder if people in the factory

503
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:47,730
would want something like that.
But just general safety things,

504
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,460
safety concerns of the customer?
This kind of thing?

505
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,890
Disha Sarawgi: Oh, yeah,
definitely. So safety is

506
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:57,630
something we take very seriously
because it's drawn with models

507
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:02,580
running at like 20,000 rpm, and
we do not want to collide into

508
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:07,410
anything or hurt anyone or not.
So we have a bunch of software

509
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:15,870
and hardware fail safes for
ensuring safety. We have bunch

510
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:22,020
of audio visual cues that we be
provide while taking off by

511
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,200
landing wire in case of

512
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:30,059
Audrow Nash: me that the drone
has a speaker and it will go

513
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:33,869
like I'm taking off now. Or like
landing now or something like

514
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:36,359
this. So people have some idea
of its intention. Yeah,

515
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,280
Disha Sarawgi: we actually do.
So we have Bibles on the drawn

516
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,360
on the landing pad, which make
it known that it's going to take

517
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:53,700
off now. Now we have a bunch of
spotlights to, like, tell people

518
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,440
where it's going to go, or it's
flying above you, you've taken

519
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,650
out or something like that, and
a bunch of flight to tell you

520
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,090
what it's doing now, like it's
on a flight or it's charging,

521
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:13,050
it's not charging stuff like
that, like anything that you can

522
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,950
as much as you can gather by
just looking at the system.

523
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,290
There will be a visual

524
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:24,870
Audrow Nash: indicators of its
status. Or audible as well. Yes.

525
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:29,880
Do you do any? So I was thinking
for hardware failsafe, like if

526
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,940
the drum does happen to
malfunction. Is there any like

527
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,950
because So you mentioned flying
above people? Is there any sort

528
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:42,480
of like I don't know failsafe
for something if the drone does

529
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,970
say for some reason, there's
just like a segfault on the

530
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:49,290
drone like worst case and it
just starts to fall. Any any

531
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,190
recourse from there?

532
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,520
Disha Sarawgi: Yeah, definitely.
That does happen sometimes. But

533
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,720
we have tried to resolve it by
software and our low level

534
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:03,180
thesis. So in case have an
emergency, which can be like a

535
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,970
mission computer, losing contact
with the landing pad or

536
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:13,710
something like that, or just
even a segfault. We try to find

537
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:18,240
a safe spot underneath the drawn
like the case, we have visual

538
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,920
information of everything around
the drone making figurative

539
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:29,040
Potter land, and the drone
navigates itself and land safely

540
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,120
around without external
intervention.

541
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,300
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. What
sensors do you have on the

542
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:36,660
drone?

543
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:43,440
Disha Sarawgi: So for a sensor
stack, we nearly have an array

544
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,810
of like 12 cameras onboard?

545
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,680
Audrow Nash: Or do they have
like infrared? Or are there any?

546
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:59,580
Like, like low light conditions
or something? Maybe I think you

547
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,380
have depth cameras as well,
probably.

548
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,770
Disha Sarawgi: Yeah. So they're
all arranged in like, do

549
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,520
fashion. So we have infrared
cameras, and then we also get

550
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:13,290
information out of them. We have
a bunch of time use and modifier

551
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:20,550
to give you a no show
information. And it's basically

552
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,590
a visual inertial system.

553
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,670
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So you have
a bunch of cameras are all of

554
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,850
the cameras, infrared depth
cameras?

555
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,470
Yeah. Yes.

556
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:38,610
Audrow Nash: Okay. And there's
no like, this is gonna sound

557
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,070
kind of silly, but there's no
like parachute on board or

558
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,010
something. If the book, I guess
the drone doesn't like hit

559
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:47,160
anything ever, or it hasn't. And
so that's you don't have to

560
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,490
worry about it, falling out
people's heads, or anything.

561
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,300
Like my track record. So it
isn't very

562
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,180
Mohammed Kabir: much. And also
another way we try to kind of

563
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,020
deal with this problem at the
root is we tell the customers to

564
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,520
schedule it in specific off
hours, when there is no traffic

565
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:09,240
in the aisles. And then we also
do us a lot of customer

566
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,420
training. And we train the
workers there that if you see

567
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,810
the drone, and it's about banter
and aisles, don't go in there,

568
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,180
wait for it to come back. It's
like probably going to spend

569
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,390
like five minutes there. So
there's a lot of like, kind of

570
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,960
human interaction between us and
the customer and the worker

571
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,800
stair which

572
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:31,470
Audrow Nash: you get exactly the
aisle, the drone is using. Okay,

573
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,320
because Disha you mentioned that
flying overhead in this kind of

574
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,170
thing. So I was imagining, like
drones, scanning people, but

575
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,430
need, and that seems risky to
me. Like I imagined my propeller

576
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:44,460
flies off or something that's
really hard to control for.

577
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,060
Disha Sarawgi: I mean, we have
safety systems in place, but

578
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,340
obviously the same sense to not
be that.

579
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:55,080
Audrow Nash: Yep. Gotcha. So it
can't, like you can't fly over

580
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,350
someone, but it's not desirable,
because it's a little bit more

581
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,150
risky. Yeah, exactly.

582
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,510
Mohammed Kabir: And variably. In
the wild, we see that someone

583
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:06,570
wanders in or someone just
didn't pay attention to what we

584
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:10,320
said. So we still design for
that kind of extreme case where

585
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,700
there's someone underneath it
all the time. But in reality,

586
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,290
that's probably like, 1% of our
international flights.

587
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,810
Audrow Nash: Yeah, I would
imagine far, far less. Yeah,

588
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:27,810
gotcha. Okay, so you have this
drone, it flies around. It uses

589
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:32,970
depth cameras. To get a sense of
the distance it is from

590
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:37,680
everything it probably. So do
you have to do? Like, do you

591
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,650
have to map the warehouse first?
Or how do you say you bring this

592
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:44,310
new drone to a new warehouse for
a new customer? How do you set

593
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:48,270
up the environment other than
putting this nest at? And by

594
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:52,140
nest? I mean, the launchpad
elevated for the drone? How else

595
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,660
do you do the setup? Do you do
some sort of mapping? Do you fly

596
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,030
the drone around? What kind of
things?

597
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:02,970
Disha Sarawgi: So yes, you are
exactly right about this. Apart

598
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:07,680
from setting the nest, we also
pre map the warehouse, which

599
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,280
means we get like geometric and
semantic information from the

600
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,650
warehouse and give the drone a
pre map environment. Based on

601
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:24,750
that we can define reasons or
slots that we want to fly in and

602
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,680
schedule missions accordingly
and fly exactly that.

603
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,570
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. And so for
mapping it, you just fly the

604
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:41,700
drone around and have it What
was it? So I understand? Right,

605
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,300
Mohammed Kabir: right, right. So
the exact process we cannot talk

606
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,170
about because it's something
we've developed internally. And

607
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,930
it's actually one of the hardest
parts of doing this even though

608
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:57,270
it may not Yeah, actually seem
so. But at the end of the day,

609
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:01,560
we're taking measurements, some
by hand Some using the vehicle

610
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,830
and then we're kind of putting
these together and generating

611
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,490
kind of a unified map for the
vehicles views.

612
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:13,440
Audrow Nash: Okay, so you will
custom generate a specific a map

613
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:18,870
for the warehouse. For that you
go off of that. Exactly. Do you

614
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,540
have problems? I guess the
shelves if they're really tall,

615
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:25,260
you don't have a problem where
they're like, move a few inches

616
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,020
or a few feet on one end, as
much.

617
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:28,950
Mohammed Kabir: Yeah,

618
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:29,970
Audrow Nash: we've actually

619
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,000
Mohammed Kabir: seen that. Yeah,
that does occur. It's ridiculous

620
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,580
again, but it does happen. Like
we have to map it again.

621
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,020
Whatever. So no, so we actually
designed into the system. Yeah.

622
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:43,860
So we have a map update method,
which basically deals with minor

623
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,100
change in the environment
automatically. So every time a

624
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,150
vehicle goes out, we can kind of
update the map and then share it

625
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,730
across the fleet. So all of the
vehicles know that. Okay, this

626
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,550
part changed a little bit. So
next time I go there, I know

627
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,090
what to do.

628
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:01,140
Audrow Nash: I see. So you're
updating a little bit with your

629
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,080
map. So you're doing some sort
of simultaneous localization and

630
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:10,620
mapping? Flight? And how does
the so when your drone I saw I

631
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:14,100
saw on the website, that you
only need internet connected to

632
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:19,230
the launch pad. And so when your
drone goes away, it needs to

633
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:23,220
probably stay within range of
the launch pad? Like why like

634
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,730
some sort of maybe it has a
router or something on the

635
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:31,740
launch pad? Or does it just does
it just go back to where the

636
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,410
launch pad is, and it doesn't
need that internet connection

637
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,080
for that period of time that it
is in flight?

638
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:40,170
Mohammed Kabir: Right? So the
way we design the system,

639
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:44,040
actually, we don't need any sort
of connection back to the launch

640
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,520
pad while in flight. So
everything all computation

641
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,810
happens on board. There is a
wireless link, but we don't

642
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:55,740
actually need it while flying.
It's just there for there's a

643
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,070
bunch of reasons why it's there.
But we don't actually require it

644
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:02,310
while flying. Also,

645
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,490
Audrow Nash: things like logging
data or something or what

646
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,650
Mohammed Kabir: pretty much
pretty much basically

647
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,140
information about flight
progress, stuff like that.

648
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,820
Audrow Nash: Oh, okay. That's
cool. Yeah. And then, but you

649
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,930
don't need that actual the
controller and the getting the

650
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:23,250
data and save saving the data
and everything that happens on

651
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:23,910
board on

652
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,120
Mohammed Kabir: exactly, it
happens all on the ground. And

653
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:30,990
that's another design decision,
which was actually driven by

654
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,800
stuff we saw. So warehouse is
like, typically it's a bunch of

655
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,400
metal racks, right? It's it's a
Faraday cage. And they're

656
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:42,450
terrible, terrible RF
propagation environments. Yeah,

657
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,990
so any sort of wireless is
destined to fail.

658
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:51,750
Audrow Nash: So that was that
was why you decided to put all

659
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:56,400
the computation on the drone.
Exactly. That's amazing. I

660
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,770
started in research in my
undergrad doing this kind of

661
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,830
thing where it was trying to put
a drone and all the computation

662
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:08,340
on the drone and having it
localize and maintain a swarm

663
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,520
formation. And it was really,
really difficult. This was like

664
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,760
10 years ago, or something. And
it's impressive now to have

665
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,300
everything and you're like
unbelievable suite of cameras on

666
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,530
your drone to it's amazing how
far things have come in the last

667
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:23,130
nine years.

668
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,430
Disha Sarawgi: We have extremely
long eyes in the warehouse as

669
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:35,550
was so that showboating that
kind of vibe firing is almost

670
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:40,920
impossible. I like like you have
made a backup pointer on it. So

671
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,460
we just had to compress
everything to onboard

672
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,330
combination.

673
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:53,130
Audrow Nash: Let's see. So now
talking a bit more about Corvus

674
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:57,750
as a company. So you got you
mentioned you started in 2017.

675
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:01,590
Will you tell me a little just
how did you decide to start a

676
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:04,740
company and then dish I'd love
to hear how did you decide to be

677
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,870
employee number two after the co
founders?

678
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,070
Mohammed Kabir: Yeah, sure, I
can start. Um, so basically. So

679
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:18,960
the company was, myself, Jackie,
our CEO, and then our two other

680
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,900
co founders, Jonathan and Brian.
And all of us, kind of happened

681
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,520
to come together. It was like a
matter of luck or chance almost.

682
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:34,380
So as the story goes, I knew
Brian and then Jackie knew

683
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:39,930
Jonathan. And then Jackie found
me on the internet in some

684
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:45,060
random IRC chat room and I was
helping people with drone

685
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:49,800
problems or something of that
sort. And what kind of got

686
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:56,910
connected there and decided to
kind of start looking into the

687
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:02,190
kinds of use cases which we
could all automate. Because

688
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:05,700
personally, I'm really into
automating anything that is

689
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,660
automatable. Just because people
should be spending their time

690
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:15,660
doing more high impact things.
So automation is really a big

691
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:20,550
part of my life. And kind of I
think this is true. Also for the

692
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:23,820
other co founders, all of them
really care about kind of this

693
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:29,250
problem space. And we sort of
came together. And it was a

694
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:35,490
really great, great team. That,
that we started with, basically,

695
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:40,740
to Brian was our hardware guy,
he's our lead of hardware today.

696
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:46,410
He does all of this. So anything
you see on the ground, it's it's

697
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:51,210
Brian, basically, all the
hardware, all of the basically

698
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:56,520
every piece, then Jonathan is
our chief of software, he does a

699
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,060
ton of work, both on the
autonomy stack, and also kind of

700
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:04,440
the almost, it's almost harder,
I would say, kind of the

701
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,710
customer integration side, which
is integrating with all these

702
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:11,310
custom systems, some of which
are from the 90s, stuff like

703
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:16,290
that. And then Jackie is our
CEO. And basically, well, yeah,

704
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:21,030
he does, he does everything. And
then all of us came together in

705
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:26,700
2017. It was like things, some,
some some point in the middle of

706
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:32,100
2017. And I told Jackie that,
okay, I know this great, good

707
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:37,050
hardware guy, my friend, we
could probably think of doing

708
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:40,200
something. And all of us came
together and decided to start

709
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,010
purpose.

710
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,430
Audrow Nash: Awesome. And how
did you pick the opportunity?

711
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,910
Like, how did you pick this
specific problem to work on?

712
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:51,420
Right?

713
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:57,030
Mohammed Kabir: So Jackie's
family back in China. They were

714
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,960
one of the very first generation
entrepreneurs in China. And he

715
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,470
had actually kind of firsthand
seen the problems that

716
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:08,460
warehouses go through. And kind
of this, like this huge thing.

717
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:12,600
Like as an outsider, like, I
personally had no idea about

718
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:17,970
what problems warehouses and
generally like industrial stuff,

719
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,020
people there go through. And
Jagga kind of introduced us to

720
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:27,720
this whole new problem space
where these sort of non sexy use

721
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,080
cases, which could still benefit
hugely from automation, like

722
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,270
it's not self driving cars, but
there's still a huge

723
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:33,900
opportunity.

724
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:39,720
Audrow Nash: Yeah, gotcha. Yeah,
that's awesome, that Jackie knew

725
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:45,060
so much. And then the shot you
joining as number two, how was

726
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:48,390
that for you? Like, how did you
decide to join this company?

727
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:51,630
Yeah. How did you like your
interest in startups at this

728
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:52,980
stage and this kind of thing.

729
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:58,800
Disha Sarawgi: So it was a bit
of both like, I personally

730
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,020
always wanted to work in an
early stage startup, because it

731
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:10,860
gives you the opportunity to
work on the entire stack, get a

732
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,740
sense of how everything's
interacting with each other,

733
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:18,720
have a good amount of ownership
on the code as well. And the

734
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,080
minute you get to learn is much
more than you would if you were

735
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:29,460
working just in a subsystem as
part of a big team. So it kind

736
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:33,930
of worked out that Jackie
reached out to me on LinkedIn, I

737
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:38,340
think. And I was in Austin at
the time, and I flew down to

738
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:44,010
Boston to meet the team. And I
was really intrigued by the work

739
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:48,510
we were doing, and just like
being a small team, like they

740
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:55,620
had come far, I guess, with the
hardware and the software at the

741
00:48:55,620 --> 00:49:02,070
time, but I saw an opportunity
to contribute as well and get

742
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:04,650
the system to where it is now
today.

743
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,490
Audrow Nash: Where are you guys
located?

744
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,390
Disha Sarawgi: So we are in
Boston, Massachusetts, at the

745
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:12,870
moment.

746
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:19,860
Audrow Nash: Awesome. Let's see.
And then just a more general

747
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:23,520
question about Corvis. How are
you guys funded? So are you

748
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,350
receiving investment or have you
received like a Series A or

749
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:29,490
like, where are you guys at?

750
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,540
Mohammed Kabir: Right? We're
Priya company. We went through Y

751
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:39,780
Combinator in 2018. We were like
the YC. Summer summer 2018.

752
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,180
Batch. Yeah. Cool.

753
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:45,660
Audrow Nash: And so you've
received what are they? They

754
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:49,590
they give it's like seed funding
kind of thing from a seed

755
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:54,210
funding. Yes. Gotcha. And then
you've just been running on that

756
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,360
and maybe pretty much are you
getting revenue from your

757
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,820
customers yet? Yeah. Proper
course.

758
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:03,060
Mohammed Kabir: But Yeah,
exactly, yeah. So we've been,

759
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:08,790
we've actually been deploying
for about one and a half years

760
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:12,240
now, we've been doing pilots
before that. But we've had, we

761
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:14,550
were doing production
deployments for quite a while

762
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:17,970
now. And all of these are active
revenue streams for the company.

763
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,570
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. And so are
you guys bootstrapping,

764
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,840
effectively where you're
reinvesting your profits back in

765
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:29,580
and you're not getting much?
Gotcha. Nice. I like that model.

766
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:33,240
Do you think that you'll be
seeking investment as a way to

767
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,630
kind of grow faster, or just
kind of stay off that keep

768
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,540
bootstrapping and keep your
equity really large? Or

769
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:40,650
Mohammed Kabir: when

770
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:41,790
Audrow Nash: I'm going forward?

771
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:44,430
Mohammed Kabir: That's that's
completely open question. We are

772
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:47,850
open to outside investment.
Because we do want to kind of

773
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:51,180
grow exponentially, we're kind
of hitting the point where we

774
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,840
want to scale up the engineering
team, the sales team, all of

775
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:59,280
that really quickly. So we're,
of course open to that. But

776
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,840
everything's on the table.

777
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,410
Audrow Nash: And you have to
find a good fit probably, right?

778
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,710
Because you guys are in a
powerful situation where you're

779
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:12,330
not exactly burning through your
money. And meeting investment,

780
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:18,510
possibly under bad terms, these
kinds of awesome. Now, let's

781
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:22,410
see, I see that we're coming
close to the time that we were

782
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:28,290
saying we should end. So what
I'd like to do for our last

783
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:32,280
little bit, is just asked you
guys general questions about

784
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:37,050
like, where robotic is going?
And then advice things. So the

785
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:41,820
shot could you start, and I
would like to know what advice

786
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,120
you would give to like a 20 year
old view?

787
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:50,250
Disha Sarawgi: Um, okay, I think
that's pretty straightforward.

788
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:57,900
Because yeah, I mean, okay, my
point is not long ago. Yeah,

789
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,080
Audrow Nash: that to someone
else added up? Yeah.

790
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:06,990
Disha Sarawgi: Well, to two
younger badasses, I would say,

791
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:17,070
just do what you love. And do
not be afraid, like, if it's an

792
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:22,320
engineering solution that you
don't know the answer to keep at

793
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,940
it, because that is what
engineers are helpful, like to

794
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:31,440
think of problems and solve them
even when you do not think of

795
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,020
answers as the first goal. So
just in general, the problem

796
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:41,520
solving aspect is engineering
appears to me. And that is what

797
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:46,080
I love doing. And if you're good
at it, keep doing it.

798
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:51,750
Audrow Nash: Let's see Kabir
same question. Advice for

799
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:52,350
younger you.

800
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:58,500
Mohammed Kabir: Vice for younger
me. Um, let's see, I think one

801
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,670
of the big things that's kind of
been a part of my engineering

802
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:06,660
journey has been open source
software, I feel really strongly

803
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:10,020
about open source, and also the
stack at corpus, which we built,

804
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,470
it leverages a lot of open
source pieces. For example, we

805
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:18,600
use ROS 1, we use the px for
autopilot stack. And I kind of

806
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,740
started interacting with all of
these at a very young age. And I

807
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:27,000
think, kind of working with a
lot of experienced people in the

808
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,870
same field. And that kind of
experience can only come from

809
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:35,610
being on a team, like
individually, there's only so

810
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:38,310
much you can do. Like you can
take classes, you can study, you

811
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:43,080
can look up stuff yourself. But
I think being a part of an open

812
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,890
source software team really gave
me a bunch of skills, which I

813
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:51,330
use everyday now. I would
really, really advise people to

814
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:55,440
kind of pick a project you love
or biggest space you love, find

815
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,370
a project in that space, and
then see where see where it

816
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:01,260
goes, you will learn a lot on
the way.

817
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:05,760
Audrow Nash: And what are some
of the most valuable parts to

818
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,250
you of contributing to open
source? So obviously, your

819
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,370
learning skills but like what
specific things were most

820
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:12,960
valuable in your experience?

821
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,240
Mohammed Kabir: Right. So when I
started, like working on drones,

822
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,290
I think this was when I was in
middle school or something. I

823
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:26,910
started looking at kind of what
the options were if I wanted to

824
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:29,940
build my own drone, and I didn't
know anything at that point. I

825
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:35,100
was just like a middle school
kid. And then eventually, I came

826
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,790
across the px for autopilot,
which is this open source

827
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:43,440
software stack for drones. And
what this lets people do is

828
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,560
there's a certain set of
supporting hardware, and you

829
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,620
keep this open source software,
put it on that and then boom,

830
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,320
you have your own drone, mess
around a little bit with the

831
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:56,790
hardware, but effectively it's a
it's a pretty easy solution if

832
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:59,160
you're trying to build something
on your own with no experience

833
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:05,070
before. And eventually what what
my story personally looked like

834
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:10,140
was I started using px for as a
user. But eventually I started

835
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:14,580
contributing back to upstream. A
lot of the things which I wanted

836
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:20,130
to do, but the features didn't
exist at the time. And

837
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:24,030
eventually what this led into
was, I became a part of the core

838
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,960
kind of maintenance team, which
maintains the entire project.

839
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:31,890
And that that branches out into
helping other people doing code

840
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:36,780
reviews, just a lot of skills,
which there was no way I thought

841
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,260
I would have learned unless I
kind of got into it in the first

842
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:40,860
place.

843
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:47,130
Audrow Nash: Awesome. Now, let's
see a wrapping up. Is there any

844
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:50,160
links that you guys would like
to share? So in the show notes,

845
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,970
we'll put a link to Corvus is
website. Anything else worth

846
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:55,590
share? Sure, we

847
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:59,280
Mohammed Kabir: have this demo
reel of Corvis. One, which we'd

848
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,790
probably like to show off. I can
send you the link after the

849
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:06,330
talk. And it'll be that'd be
pretty nice. I

850
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:09,629
Audrow Nash: think you guys have
social media or anything you'd

851
00:56:09,629 --> 00:56:11,429
like to share the shot? Do you
have anything?

852
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:17,640
Disha Sarawgi: Yeah, we do have
garbage on the garbage website,

853
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,600
and it was on Twitter. And we
will send you all the links.

854
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:24,360
Mohammed Kabir: Yeah, we'll send
your Twitter handles and

855
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,370
LinkedIn and whatever else.

856
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,670
Audrow Nash: Okay, great. Well,
it's been a pleasure speaking

857
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:31,740
with both of you. It's been a
pleasure.

858
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:34,470
Disha Sarawgi: Thanks for taking
time.

859
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:39,990
Audrow Nash: Thanks for
listening to this conversation

860
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:44,940
with Disha and Kabir. Thank you
again to our founding sponsor,

861
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,670
Open Robotics, and I hope to see
you next time
