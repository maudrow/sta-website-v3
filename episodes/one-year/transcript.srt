Audrow Nash: I'm happy to announce
this week is our one year anniversary

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,540
for the Sense Think Act Podcast.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:14,990
During this year, we've had 23 episodes
and had about 53,000 downloads.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,050
I'm humbled and honored that
we've reached so many people.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,210
I've also loved the opportunity
to have longer conversations with

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,445
great people through this podcast.

7
00:00:25,805 --> 00:00:30,005
I love seeing how they think and
what they're thinking about, which I

8
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:31,955
think this longer format lets me do.

9
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:36,485
And I'm happy that I get to share
these conversations with you all

10
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:40,055
and hope that you enjoy them and
find them valuable as much as I do.

11
00:00:41,485 --> 00:00:44,005
All that to say, we're
just getting started.

12
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:47,485
I'm excited about our upcoming
episodes, including an interview

13
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:52,270
with Nvidia, on hardware acceleration
and machine learning, Esper

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,580
Bionics on prosthetic devices, and
Plus One Robotics, on exception

15
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,530
handling in the warehouse setting.

16
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:02,113
Look for these interviews
in the coming months.

17
00:01:02,683 --> 00:01:05,863
If you're enjoying this podcast,
I'd be happy if you give it a thumbs

18
00:01:05,863 --> 00:01:08,743
up or leave us a review depending
on which platform you're on.

19
00:01:09,523 --> 00:01:13,603
And a big thanks to Open Robotics
who has been sponsoring this podcast.

20
00:01:13,683 --> 00:01:14,553
That's all for now.

21
00:01:14,643 --> 00:01:16,083
And I look forward to our next year.
