1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,490
Audrow Nash: This is a
conversation with Dan Mantz, who

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,670
is the CEO of The Robotics
Education at Competition

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,940
Foundation, also known as the
REC Foundation, which is a

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,270
nonprofit that works with VEX
robotics to build interest in

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,000
STEM related career
opportunities. In this

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,440
interview, Dan reveals that he
sees a problem. We have a large

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,260
labor shortage for technical
positions. This includes

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,840
engineers, but also more
vocational roles like

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,860
technicians, and this shortage
might get worse. So Dan and the

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,360
REC Foundation are working to
expose students to stem through

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,290
robotics competitions. These
competitions balance difficulty,

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,470
how much they appeal to
students, how easy they are to

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,700
facilitate for the schools, and
the cost of the equipment so

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,000
that they can be as widely
available as possible. It was

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,450
great talking to Dan and I
learned how he and his team are

16
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,570
trying to pragmatically solve
the labor shortage through

17
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,130
education. And I think their
mission is important. Also, it

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,250
was surprising to me to learn
how their program really helped

19
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,760
students to learn soft skills,
such as working on a team and

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,180
problem solving, almost as a
byproduct of the students

21
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,260
participating. Yet Dan says
that those soft skills are one

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,080
of the most valuable things for
students to learn in their

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,720
careers, whether they stay in
robotics or do something

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,650
different. I'm Audrow Nash.
This is the Sense Think Act

25
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,100
Podcast. Thank you to our
founding sponsor, Open Robotics.

26
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,260
And now here's my conversation
with Dan Mantz. Will you

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,100
introduce yourself?

28
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,720
Dan Mantz: Hi, first, thanks for
having me on today. But my name

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,500
is Dan Mantz. I am the CEO of
The Robotics Education and

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,730
Competition Foundation. You'll
hear me say REC Foundation,

31
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,810
throughout the course of the
discussion. And we're based here

32
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,550
in Greenville, Texas, about 45
miles east of Dallas. So you'll

33
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,730
hear me just say we're in the
Dallas area. And we're one of

34
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:04,170
the largest not for profits for
STEM education, with a

35
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,970
specialist on robotics and
drones and workforce

36
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,510
development.

37
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,750
Audrow Nash: Can you give me an
idea of some of your

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,610
competitions that you guys host?

39
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,730
Dan Mantz: Absolutely. So our
largest competition, what we're

40
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,480
most known for is the VEX
Robotics Competition. And that

41
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,680
was launched over 15 years ago
now or 15 years into the VEX

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,480
Robotics continuum. It started
basically as a high school

43
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,560
middle school program, but it's
evolved into so much more. So we

44
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,650
call the high school program
with the metal parts and the

45
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,750
larger motors that's VRC. We
also have a very, very popular

46
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,660
Middle School and mid elementary
program called VEX IQ. That's

47
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,530
our fastest growing program.
It's even larger now than our

48
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,280
VEX Robotics Competition, our
VRC program, interesting for

49
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,050
early elementary, we have FX go,
which is a fantastic, really

50
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,860
great program that we developed
and released during the

51
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,730
pandemic, for students to really
start learning how to build

52
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,610
things in programming. There's
Vex 123 4k through two. And then

53
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,640
unlike so many other robotics
competitions out there, we

54
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,230
actually have a university
program called FX u. And that

55
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,520
draws students from across the
across the world of both two

56
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,750
year and four year colleges.
Also, another competition we

57
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,990
launched last year is Vex AI for
artificial intelligence

58
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,280
competition, and that's where
the robots use cameras and GPS

59
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,110
sensors, and they do everything
without manual driving. Outside

60
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,020
of our VEX robotics
competitions, we run the

61
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:51,750
robotics competitions for
SkillsUSA. And for TSA. We also

62
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,430
run Bell VRC, which stands for
vertical robotics competition.

63
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,080
So Bell Helicopter, based here
in Texas, we run their

64
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,210
competitions, we have some rad
competitions. We call it rad C,

65
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,440
which stands for REC Foundation,
aerial drones competition. And

66
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,890
then one of my favorite programs
that we run is our factory

67
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,430
automation competition. And
that's for students, build

68
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,510
conveyors and robots that
simulates a distribution center.

69
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,170
So we do the full spectrum of
mobile robotics. That's the Vex

70
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:30,450
platform, aerial, which is the
Bell Helicopter, and then our

71
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,600
drones as well as workforce
development with our factory

72
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,220
automation competition.

73
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,720
Audrow Nash: That's quite a lot.
How so how large are you guys?

74
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,240
Dan Mantz: Yeah, it's
interesting, somewhat, a lot of

75
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,060
people haven't heard the REC
foundation or they just think

76
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,090
VEX robotics, but we're actually
in 80 countries. We're in all 50

77
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,640
states. Pre pandemic, we had
30,000 teams just in our FX

78
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,650
program since often and between
our on in education and our

79
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,660
coding programs, we reach over a
million students. And you know,

80
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,930
the pandemic didn't really slow
us down. It caused us to look at

81
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,140
things a little bit differently.
But we put a lot more emphasis

82
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,310
on virtual and remote. But we do
believe building robots and

83
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,690
building drones is a key to what
we do. So we actually still

84
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,290
continued to the pandemic, we
had real competitions, but we

85
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,070
developed a technology called
live remote competition, live

86
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,820
remote tournament, and students
still built their robots. And we

87
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,450
connected students from
different places across the

88
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,210
world. And they still competed.
Of course, we had to modify the

89
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,380
game. But we persevered through
the pandemic, and we continue to

90
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,430
grow. So I have a staff of 50 in
the United States, full time

91
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,180
employees, we have another 30
part time employees that help us

92
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,810
run competitions. And then
internationally, we have a team

93
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,160
of six regional support managers
based in different countries

94
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,530
that support our international
competitions.

95
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:06,299
Audrow Nash: How do you? How do
you get funding? So like it's a

96
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,229
lot of people to?

97
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,200
Dan Mantz: Yes, it is. We're an
interesting model. It's a it's a

98
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,630
kind of like a what I call a
museum model, right. So we have

99
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,010
multiple revenue sources, which
is really good for us. So our

100
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,780
largest revenue is actually from
our registration fees. So VEX

101
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,010
robotics team will pay $150 for
the first team. And then if they

102
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,340
have multiple teams in the
organization, it's $100. All so

103
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,630
if you're talking 30,000 teams,
you can do the math, we also get

104
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,490
a lot of corporate sponsorship.
Now, Northrop Grumman Foundation

105
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,960
is our presenting sponsor, but
so many of the names that you

106
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,210
know, are big supporters of our
program, Google, Dell, Texas

107
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,530
Instruments, NAFSA, Tesla, all
those organizations, and many,

108
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:01,620
many others, give us funding to
keep our programs going and to

109
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,130
grow our programs. And then
we're also get government

110
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,710
funding to through grants. So
for example, that we were the

111
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,970
recipient of advanced robotics
and manufacturing grant on ARM

112
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,240
grant out of Pittsburgh, that
helped us develop our factory

113
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,250
work cell competition, we get
money from the Department of

114
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,200
Defense for growing programs.
For example, in Hawaii, we have

115
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,620
a grant right now to grow
programs in Hawaii. And we get a

116
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,290
lot of state funding. So for
example, in Texas, we're

117
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,350
recipients of the Texas
Workforce Commission that helps

118
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,970
us grow competitions and teams
in Texas. So it's not quite a

119
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,400
third, third, third, but it's
definitely three different

120
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,460
revenue sources, marine
government grants, corporate

121
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,470
funding, and team registrations,

122
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,680
Audrow Nash: Team registrations
and team registrations. Are the

123
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,900
like student teams registering
to compete in the challenges,

124
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,670
right? Or they're absolutely

125
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,210
Dan Mantz: yeah, so we keep our
price entry really, really low

126
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,440
compared to some other programs
out there. Again, it's $150 for

127
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,880
that first team, and probably
about 70% of our teams compete,

128
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,140
their extracurricular. Over half
of them are tied to schools. But

129
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,740
we also have teams that are tied
to Girl Scouts, for example, a

130
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,680
great partnership with the Girl
Scouts. So we have Girl Scout

131
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,160
teams, and we have private club
teams, we even have homeschool

132
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,360
teams. And then the another
growing trend in this industry

133
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,070
is robotics is becoming more and
more integrated into classrooms,

134
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,700
science and engineering
programs. So a lot of times we

135
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,360
see this in Nevada, for example,
they don't meet extracurricular,

136
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,730
they actually have their
robotics team as part of their

137
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,750
classroom. Oh, I love that. And,
and so but to compete in our

138
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,440
program, you do have to register
that covers the overhead of

139
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,400
running the programs. But we
actually don't charge for the

140
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,850
events that we run, we actually
have a network of volunteers

141
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,480
called Event partners, and they
run the events on our behalf.

142
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,300
You know, we're the overseeing
organization, think about Little

143
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,510
League. And our event partners
will charge a token amount

144
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:11,550
anywhere from 35 to $100 to run
an event, and then they keep the

145
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,230
revenue. So over the course of a
year, we'll have 3000 robotics

146
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,100
competitions, we'll have
hundreds of drones competitions,

147
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,540
and then with like our Vex go
program will have many, many in

148
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,740
class challenges and
competitions. Yeah. Wow.

149
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,269
Audrow Nash: That's not how does
it work with countries. Other so

150
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:36,299
you mentioned a lot of countries
are doing this as well. And you

151
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:38,279
mentioned most of the sponsors,
maybe it's just the ones you

152
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,639
mentioned mentioned are US based
or US government and this kind

153
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,639
of thing. How does it How does
it work with other countries

154
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,629
outside of the US?

155
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,950
Dan Mantz: Sure, absolutely. So
we still as the REC Foundation,

156
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,730
we still have the same rules for
the challengers in games and

157
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,390
stuff like that, but we use our
support outside and they will

158
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,870
collect registrations if they're
a federal Lau for example, in

159
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,500
China, we have 4000 teams in
China. And they actually don't

160
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,920
pay a registration fee. It's
covered by the government, for

161
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,920
example. But at the end of the
day, the teams still register

162
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,100
and they still play the same
game. And then our competition

163
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,390
model is it's you start locally,
and a lot of local competitions

164
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,210
and then you'll go to a regional
level and a national level,

165
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,060
we're under playing with the
same rules, the same game, the

166
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,510
same game elements. And that's
what's so popular is it

167
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,810
culminates in our world
championship, which is actually

168
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,200
being held in Dallas in May.
It's the VEX robotics world

169
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,880
championship, where 3000 of the
top teams from across the world

170
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,890
come together, we have four
different competitions, and each

171
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,760
competition will crown a world
champion. That's awesome. But it

172
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,030
the funding to you do bring up a
really good point, as we talk

173
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,410
about a lot of times we talk
about our global sponsors, but

174
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,830
each country, each state, even
every town will have a sponsor.

175
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,310
And here's a good example,
Honda. So Honda is technically

176
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,240
not a sponsor of the REC
foundation. But Honda does so

177
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,200
much for VEX robotics programs
in Ohio. And so they give to

178
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,640
local chapters, and they sponsor
teams, a TVA, Tennessee Valley

179
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,790
Authority, while they are sort
of sponsor the REC Foundation,

180
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:22,350
they do an incredible job of
giving funding, giving equipment

181
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,030
to teams in the Tennessee Valley
area. And internationally, for

182
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,680
example, shell Exxon Mobil,
those companies will sponsor

183
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,910
teams and programs. Matter of
fact, of pre pandemic I was even

184
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,510
in China have sponsored by
Alibaba. So if you don't know

185
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,110
Alibaba is like the Google of
China, for example, or excuse

186
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,610
me, Amazon of China, and they
actually fund the national

187
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,140
championship there, they brought
me over. So it's and then but we

188
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,870
shouldn't even forget about the
mom and pop stores to the subway

189
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,220
shops, the pizza shops, the
local gas station, they all fund

190
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,580
teams and stuff like that. So
it's a huge ecosystem of how

191
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,330
teams get funded. And it's
emerging to I mean, right now,

192
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,690
it's not just private, its
schools are really investing in

193
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,300
these type of programs, and
putting more and more of their

194
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,330
budget into in class and
extracurricular robotics

195
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,140
competitions.

196
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,800
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Gotcha. It's
amazing to me your reach with

197
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,790
this, how far it's going and
with a staff of only 50 people,

198
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,880
and then 30 that are part time
in this kind of thing. And then

199
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,330
you have the volunteers. How
does it? So from your

200
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,510
perspective of actually running
this and setting this up and

201
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,470
having this big reach? What do
you guys do? Is it like you're

202
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,710
setting the standards? Or you're
creating the curriculum? Or how

203
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,400
does it work?

204
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:44,699
Dan Mantz: All of the above. And
it's interesting, because I'm

205
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:47,639
glad you appreciate what we're
able to accomplish lost a small

206
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,509
staff, it's, it's not a fact,
sometimes I think I've stretched

207
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:56,459
our staff too much. But it's the
model that we chose. And the

208
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:00,269
model is to rely on volunteers
and partners that aren't on the

209
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:04,769
payroll, right. And but what we
do you know, a lot of teams say,

210
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:08,189
hey, what do I get for my $150?
Right? What do I get for my $100

211
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:11,729
registration fee. So primarily,
one of the most visible things

212
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:15,449
we do is we work for example,
with the VEX Robotics on

213
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:20,429
designing the games every year.
So the IQ program has the VEX IQ

214
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:24,869
challenge to go Mexico program
has their little competition,

215
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:29,669
and then the VRC competition. So
a lot of our staff are spending

216
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:32,969
their time to develop that game
and develop the resources, it

217
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:35,879
comes with manuals, it comes
with videos, you have to support

218
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:39,929
it. So that's a you know, one of
the things that we do, we also

219
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:43,049
work with our event partners to
help them run good events. And

220
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:45,869
that's where a lot of our part
time employees come in. So we

221
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:48,989
have a series of team engagement
managers and of engagement

222
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:52,259
managers that support
competitions in the United

223
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:54,329
States. And then we have
regional support managers

224
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:58,709
internationally. And they work
very, very closely with our

225
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:04,079
volunteers to make sure that
they run events that meet our

226
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,199
standards. So again, I think
good models, if you think about

227
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,159
Little League, you know, the
Little League Association sets

228
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:15,299
the rules, but each local level
runs their own baseball camps,

229
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,379
right? So we kind of do the same
thing, but we're very important.

230
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,359
And one of the things that
distinguishes us from other

231
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:25,049
programs is we really believe in
student centered. So we're not a

232
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:27,929
program that encourages the
parents or coaches to do the

233
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:32,849
work. Matter of fact, in our
program, our code of conduct and

234
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:35,819
our students centered policies
is about the students doing the

235
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:38,729
work. It's not about building
the world's best robot. It's

236
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:41,909
about learning, engineering and
problem solving and

237
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:46,019
communication skills through the
students doing hands on work. So

238
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:49,049
a lot of my staff are team
engagement managers or event

239
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:51,959
engagement managers, they're
working with the coaches and the

240
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,139
event partners to make sure that
we follow the ecosystem. And

241
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:58,709
like any organization of course,
we have accounting. We have

242
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:01,589
marketing, we have to
development we have those

243
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:05,189
infrastructure to it's I pay my
staff, we try to pay

244
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:09,389
competitively. And we give our
staff free health care, for

245
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:13,889
example. wonderlands. So we have
an HR department. So we have all

246
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:16,439
those types of things that are
standard business as to

247
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,850
Audrow Nash: how does it work?
Can you tell me a little bit

248
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,890
about being a nonprofit with
that?

249
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,840
Dan Mantz: Sure. So I personally
come from the for profit world,

250
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,950
my entire career was for profit,
I joined the REC foundation

251
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,610
board over five years ago, and
ultimately ended up as the CEO

252
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,030
here. But I didn't have a lot of
experience. So I'm learning to

253
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,750
but you know, I'm not for profit
still has to pay their bills,

254
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,470
definitely, we still have to
generate revenue, provide value

255
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,890
and pay our bills for being a
not for profit, what allows us

256
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,600
to do is get those foundation
donations, for example, the

257
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,780
Northrop Grumman Foundation are
our largest presenting sponsor,

258
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,690
and allows us to get those
government funds, but we have to

259
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,990
do due diligence, we have to
show the funders of our

260
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,110
organization, whether it's the
government or private, that

261
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,260
we're good stewards of their
money. So again, we have

262
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,550
probably spend, you know, 4000
hours a year between audits and

263
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,270
reporting and stuff like that.
So like anybody familiar with

264
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,330
any business out there, we get
revenue, and we have expenses.

265
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,410
And at the end of the year, the
board that I report to expects

266
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,940
me to bring in more money than
I've spent. But then we have to

267
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,310
account for that money to the
people that fund us.

268
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:37,649
Audrow Nash: How do you think of
profit versus nonprofit in this?

269
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,160
Dan Mantz: Well, I think that's
a great question. And actually

270
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,510
one that I've never really been
asked before. But I think I

271
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,360
think the challenges of a not
for profit, is there's an

272
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,780
expectation that you can do
things cheaper. So there's an

273
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,810
expectation, you can hire people
cheaper and something like that.

274
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,620
And that's not true. If we want
to be the best STEM education

275
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,740
and robotics not for profit out
there, we still have to pay

276
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,090
competitively. But because we
have, we don't have just a

277
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:09,990
customer buying our product that
basically tells us whether we're

278
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,770
successful or not. We have so
many different customers in our

279
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,460
program. I mean, primarily for
us, the teak the students, and

280
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,520
the educators are our primary
customer, our programs are for

281
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,060
them. So that's who I'm trying
to please first. But we also

282
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,540
have to make sure that if we get
federal money, that they're

283
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,790
satisfied with how we're
spending the money, if we're

284
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,760
getting corporate sponsorship,
we're doing the things they

285
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,640
expect us to do. And I think
that's the big difference. So I

286
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,210
was president of a company
called rack solutions. We made

287
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,270
infrastructure products for data
centers, primarily sheet metal

288
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,720
products. And if I came out with
a new product, if rock solutions

289
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,440
came out with a new product, and
it's sold, we knew it was

290
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,950
successful. That was our answer.
And if it didn't sell, then we

291
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,790
made a bad engineering or sales
decision for a not for profit,

292
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,180
it's not so black and white,
right? So I can have a program

293
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,630
that the students love. But if
the coaches and the teachers

294
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,690
don't like it, it's not a
success, I can have a program

295
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,410
that the funders think is
excellent. But if nobody wants

296
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,380
to do it in their schools or
extracurricular, it's not so the

297
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,430
city's argue your customer? I'm
sorry, can you have to satisfy

298
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,760
all of the parties in it? And
that's the challenge. And it's

299
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,700
people ask me, Is it easier to
run a not for profit, you don't

300
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,670
have this pressure of like
having a return on investment

301
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,940
for? You know, like a
stockholder? I'm like, no, it's

302
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,370
actually for me much more
difficult to run a not for

303
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:32,880
profit.

304
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,610
Audrow Nash: Yeah. I mean, so
I've been involved with like,

305
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,980
when I was very involved with
Robo hub, which is a robotics

306
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,430
news organization, we were a
nonprofit. So I, I feel like

307
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,340
I've been through some of the
like pain of being in a

308
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,520
nonprofit. But I think you can
do a lot of good work and not be

309
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,930
accountable to not necessarily
have the economics drive the

310
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,440
mission of the thing. But can
you tell me kind of like, why

311
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,250
not go for profit, or this kind
of thing?

312
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,930
Dan Mantz: Well, I think the
biggest reason is, we don't want

313
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,800
to become a for profit is
because I want to be able to

314
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,140
just breakeven for one sec for
the year, I don't want to have

315
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,170
to have a return to
shareholders. So that really

316
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:17,010
allows us to keep the prices as
low as possible and maximize

317
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,180
value for our customers. So
that's one good reason. So we

318
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,030
had the difficult decision of
raising our registration fee.

319
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,670
After five years, we've gone
five years without raising

320
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,820
registration fees. But if you're
reading the news, you know how

321
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,330
bad inflation is right now. And
that affects us to insurance

322
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,480
costs are up the gasoline
everything. So we had to raise

323
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,710
our registration fees for the
first time in five years, but

324
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:45,300
because I am just trying to
break even, it wouldn't have

325
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,960
been as large as maybe if I was
trying to maximize revenue for

326
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,100
shareholders. But then again,
also being a not for profit.

327
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,630
There's great companies out
there. Google, for example, that

328
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:04,170
really invest deeply into our,
our programs for the underserved

329
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,560
community for Title One
students, women in STEM, etc.

330
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,250
And that's another reason to
stay as a not for profit,

331
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,330
because these corporate sponsors
will really invest in you if

332
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,300
you're doing something that they
feel is going to help them out

333
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,810
the long term to our corporate
sponsors are amazing when NASA

334
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:26,940
invests in us because they want
that next generation of people

335
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,750
developing the Mars Rover
mission. For example, when Tesla

336
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,840
invests in us, it's because they
want that next generation of

337
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,130
workers for their new truck
factory in Austin, and for the

338
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,360
Gigafactory, outside of Reno,
Nevada, right. So they're about

339
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,660
us developing the workforce. And
you know, NASA is about

340
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,650
developing the engineers and ti
tech system, it's about the next

341
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,370
generation of computer
scientists. And that allows us

342
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,570
as a not for profit to better
serve those funders of our

343
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,410
programs.

344
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:05,370
Audrow Nash: Awesome. How does
it? So how do the different

345
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,960
competitions compare? So when
you have the young elementary

346
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,690
school students or you have the
middle school or high school?

347
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,230
How do these different
university as well? How do these

348
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,350
different programs and different
challenges compare?

349
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,620
Dan Mantz: Yeah, that's a great
question. And in a sense,

350
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,780
they're a progression, a word
that I like to use as they

351
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:29,100
progress. So if you're doing Vex
go, you still have a challenge,

352
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,660
and you're still building cars
that the first thing I have, is

353
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,290
our first competition. So as you
know, third, and fourth graders

354
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,040
is the priority,

355
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,070
Audrow Nash: low IQ, RC, and I
don't remember what the

356
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,150
university wants. So

357
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,420
Dan Mantz: what technically have
123 That's an entry level

358
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,090
programming K through two, but
we don't have a competition for

359
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:52,110
that we have in class
activities, then we have Vex go,

360
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,140
which is third and fourth
graders. Again, it's simpler,

361
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,710
build simpler programming,
understand the concepts, then

362
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,700
you get up to IQ. And that's not
a competition where two teams

363
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,490
are facing each other, they're
actually collaborating. When

364
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,000
things I love about IQ, as the
students work together, the two

365
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,780
teams work together to get the
most points. And now you get to

366
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,010
VRC and NBRC. Now, it's a two v
two competition, right, so now

367
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,430
you're playing defense, and
you're strategizing with a

368
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:24,240
partner, and how to beat an
opposing Alliance and, and the

369
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,290
power of the motors is bigger,
and the programming, all of our

370
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:32,880
competition and VRC starts with
a 15 second autonomous mode,

371
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,540
right? So the first 15 seconds
are robots moving to score

372
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,900
points and win the odd time
bonus. And then you get to vex

373
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,520
you, which now it's the same way
bigger motors, but now you're 3d

374
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,090
printing your parts, and there's
a lot more customization. And

375
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,270
then you get to the AI
competition. And now it's

376
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:55,290
advanced programming. And now
you're using GPS sensors. And

377
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:59,460
you're using high end cameras to
do data exchanges between robots

378
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,870
to solve it. So. But the nice
thing about our program is if

379
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:08,490
you start with, you know, 123,
and you start coding, all that

380
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,060
coding just grows and grows and
grows, and the concepts of how

381
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,450
you build, and the soft skills,
which are so important to these

382
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,800
programs, how you troubleshoot.
I'm an engineer, by background,

383
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,000
I worked 21 years at FANUC,
robotics and core to the REC

384
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,840
foundation programs is our
design process. So wherever you

385
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,910
start in our programs, the
design process of identifying

386
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,310
your challenge and how you're
going to solve the challenge and

387
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,880
score points, and then the
process of iteration design,

388
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,450
right. So trying something
designing something, building it

389
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:46,200
failing, and then persevering
that permeates through our

390
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,560
entire program, whether you're
at the very beginning, or you're

391
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,390
doing facts you and AI.

392
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,210
Audrow Nash: Gotcha, I really
like that. I feel like failing

393
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,230
is so important. Because if you
don't ever fail, you don't it's

394
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,170
like you you learn limitations.
And you have to work with those

395
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,720
limitations. And you can't
really make anything interesting

396
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,420
unless you're failing, most
likely. So I like that it's

397
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,230
baked into the

398
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,260
Dan Mantz: curriculum. Yeah.
When I became CEO, we stepped

399
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,420
back and we looked at our
mission and vision and we just

400
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,270
tweaked our mission. mean, our
mission is to increase student

401
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:19,080
interest in STEM by engaging
students and hands on affordable

402
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,240
and sustainable Robotics
Engineering Programs. Right. So

403
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,240
we made it less worried that if
that stayed the same, but what

404
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,700
we really changed was our
vision. Because for me, I wanted

405
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,310
people to know that we want
students to innovate and

406
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,640
experience failure and
persevere, right. So we

407
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,750
literally set our vision is
where students design and

408
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,380
innovate as part of a team and
they actually fail and in our

409
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,710
program, because we're a year
round program, students fail a

410
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,920
lot, but that's not a bad thing.
I mean, they learn from that and

411
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,790
they persevere and then they
become much more confident and

412
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,850
they work the world better
place, right. And these skills,

413
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:00,210
whether they go into robotics,
or they go into medicine, or or

414
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:05,370
they work in marketing, or
they're working, you know, as a

415
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,420
technician, those skills by
failing and persevering are

416
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,620
lifelong skills.

417
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,150
Audrow Nash: What do you So you
mentioned mission and the

418
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,580
mission is to increase
engagement and your mission

419
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,330
vision, how do those how to
mission and vision relate to

420
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:21,630
you?

421
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:25,289
Dan Mantz: I think, you know,
first of all, one of the things

422
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:28,649
we talk, if we circle back to
working for a not for profit,

423
00:25:28,739 --> 00:25:31,499
one of the things I really try
to do is make sure that the

424
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:34,199
decisions we make in this
organization are missing driven,

425
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:37,799
we have so many opportunities to
go into the next great thing.

426
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:41,639
But that mission of increasing
student interest in STEM

427
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:46,139
through, you know, hands on
affordable robotics programs, is

428
00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:49,949
the core of what we do. And so
we have our mission, we're

429
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:53,639
developing these robotics and
engineering programs for our

430
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:57,029
students. And it's evolving,
that's also workforce

431
00:25:57,029 --> 00:26:01,319
development programs, too. And
then the vision is, is more

432
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:05,279
captured of what we want to see
these students do in the future.

433
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,819
And that's, you know, persevere,
become lifelong learners.

434
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,569
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. How do you
so when you are developing these

435
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:15,989
curriculum, or these
competitions? How do you

436
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:20,009
balance, like, all of the
different factors, so there, you

437
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:23,489
could make it too difficult? You
could make it to like, really,

438
00:26:23,489 --> 00:26:25,709
really appealing to the
students, but it's like a video

439
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:29,399
game, and they're not actually
learning anything? Or, like,

440
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:32,069
there's all these different
things. How do you think about

441
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:35,639
actually designing these
competitions to make them and

442
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:36,929
gauging for students?

443
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,120
Dan Mantz: That's a great
question. And it's a really hard

444
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,360
process. When I joined the REC
foundation, I would have never

445
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,240
guessed help difficult game
designers. And that's what we

446
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,020
call it, we call it game design.
And so there is a game design

447
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:53,850
committee. It's a collaboration
between VEX robotics and the REC

448
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:58,230
foundation for the Vex programs.
It's a collaboration with NASA

449
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:04,350
for the win, and REC Foundation
staff for our our drones,

450
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:08,400
competition, and then Bell and
many Bell suppliers in the REC

451
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,490
foundation for our bell VRC
program. So first of all, all

452
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,520
three programs that have
competitions, it starts as a

453
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,030
collaboration. And then you're
really trying to define what

454
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,570
your outcome for that season is
going to be. But our program has

455
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:26,040
a bell curve, right. And on the
competition side, especially the

456
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,910
top teams, which are the top
10%, they care about winning

457
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,000
more than anything, right. But
from my perspective as CEO for

458
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,060
the REC Foundation, that's not
what we're trying to do, we're

459
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,480
looking at the entire bell
curve, and making sure that they

460
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,900
can, you know, get something
that matches our mission out of

461
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,590
this. So we will literally
design a game with an easy

462
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,230
scoring component, right?
Something that every team can

463
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,560
do. And then we have more
complex. And we want to make

464
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,350
sure that we wait it. So what
are the challenges even after

465
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,470
you brainstorm games, and you
get it down on paper. And of

466
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,650
course, you have to design your
field elements and your game

467
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,200
elements. So you have mechanical
engineers, and electrical

468
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,020
engineers that are designing
this, you have to hit a cost

469
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,380
target, right, we can develop
some of the world's best games.

470
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:14,910
But if it costs $5,000, for each
team to buy game elements, it

471
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,510
can't do it. So we have very
strong cost elements. So you do

472
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:22,140
all that. But then you start
designing how you're going to

473
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,590
play the game, and the REC
foundation and VEX robotics for

474
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:29,700
our Vex competitions, we
actually release a couple of

475
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,970
robots for different levels so
that everybody that plays the

476
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,450
game can achieve at least some
of the game objectives. And

477
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,330
that's the key, right? Like,
I'll admit, we've made games

478
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,360
that people have figured out in
the first month, and they've

479
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,720
maxed the score, and we've had
to tweak the rules. And we've

480
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,190
made our games that were maybe
just a little more complex than

481
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:54,060
we expected to at the beginning.
But it's a team of engineers and

482
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:58,050
non engineers that are looking
everything. And also, you know,

483
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,520
the other thing, people don't
realize this, so we have to

484
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,820
think about transportation.
Because we're running 3000

485
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,480
competitions a year, somebody's
got to go set this game up at

486
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,350
the library or the school or the
gym, you know, different places.

487
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,840
So we have to make sure that the
game can be torn down and

488
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,470
assembled easily too. So that
all goes into it. So when people

489
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,320
ask like you did earlier, you
know, where's that registration

490
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,650
fee goes to the game design
committee is 12 people. We're

491
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,650
all in different roles. And
there's a lot of engineering

492
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,130
behind that. And it's expensive
to develop one of these games

493
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:34,020
and we release new games every
single year for both IQ and for

494
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:39,030
VRC. And our drones programs to
we have new games every year for

495
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,840
drones to

496
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,220
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So you
mentioned you said you have

497
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,660
different robots for it. So it's
like people will register their

498
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:53,400
team that happens each year I
suppose. And then you have like

499
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,640
different key basically how to
teams get their parts and I

500
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,970
think you were saying something
about like different levels of

501
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,690
robot that they can have for the
competition or something.

502
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,540
Dan Mantz: Yeah, so every one of
the things about our program is

503
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,480
we want it to be affordable and
accessible and sustainable.

504
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,170
Right. So once you've bought for
them talking next program here,

505
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:17,580
but once you bought a Vex kit,
you can reuse that those parts

506
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,670
year after year, now there's
some wear and tear over time,

507
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,490
you're probably going to buy a
replacement motor to etcetera,

508
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:27,780
but use those parts. But you
know, you can build with a with

509
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,510
a basic robotics kit, you can
build a claw bot, right and a

510
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:34,350
call bot can do a couple basic
functions, what Vex engineering

511
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,620
does every year, they also
design a hero bot. And so a hero

512
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,340
bot can play the game at a
little bit higher level, right.

513
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,350
So they're not going to be a
state champion or world

514
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:47,280
champion, but at least allows
you to execute and be successful

515
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,040
at more of the game challenges.
And then, you know, we work with

516
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,800
other people, and people will
develop an even more advanced

517
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,430
version of the robot for that
game. But ultimately, we're not

518
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:00,120
going to release a design. For
the world's best robot, we want

519
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,420
the teams and the students to do
that. But it's really important

520
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,240
to understand there's a lot of
clubs out there and a lot of

521
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,790
classrooms that they're just
going to compete one or two

522
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:12,240
times, and they don't care about
winning, they want the the fun

523
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,780
of going to a competition and
seeing how they do. And so we

524
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,600
want them to be successful. So
that's why we released some,

525
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,510
some designs the hero bot so
that they can at least achieve

526
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,220
success at certain parts of the
game.

527
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,880
Audrow Nash: Definitely, how do
you find your price point for

528
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,090
that? So if you, you're going to
make a robot kit and that robot

529
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:33,450
kit? You want it accessible to
the majority of schools? How do

530
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,570
you? How do you figure out what
they can afford? And what you

531
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,570
can include and what you can do
with that? Well, that's

532
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,640
Dan Mantz: always the debate,
right? What can what can people

533
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,470
afford? So if we're talking
about the game elements, that's

534
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,610
probably an easier one, right?
So every year, we want teams to

535
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:51,330
be able to if you're in IQ, you
spend $100, so you can get that

536
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:55,260
game element. So it's a little
bit more expensive for the VRC

537
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,670
program. So basically, that is a
limiting factor, to be honest.

538
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,400
So anyway, any engineers
listening to this will tell you

539
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,990
that if you have tooling costs
for these parts, there's a real

540
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:10,500
cost to make these parts, you
got to cover shipping. So it's a

541
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,740
really limiting factor. Here's a
good example. So this year is

542
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,950
game, you could shoot balls,
right? And they were more like

543
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:21,030
hacky sack balls, this is in the
IQ. And I forget how many we

544
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:25,170
have on the field, shame on me,
but say there was 24 Maybe the

545
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:29,100
game would have been harder to
max out if we would have had 28.

546
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:34,170
But you know, for $100, we can
only afford to design tool,

547
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,030
manufacturing chips. So that's a
like a limiting factor. Or maybe

548
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,370
everybody in the community
always wants a water game,

549
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:44,730
right? Everybody always want to
have a water game. Could we do a

550
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,210
water game? Yes. Will we do a
water game someday to the

551
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:52,290
community out there? You never
say never. But the price point

552
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:55,770
to now have waterproof motors
and sensors and stuff like that

553
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,560
just doesn't make it realistic.
I mean, we these are high

554
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,370
schools and in junior High's and
middle schools and elementary

555
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:05,880
schools that are primarily
buying this. So we can't have

556
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,650
very expensive products out
there.

557
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,580
Audrow Nash: And what are the
kids look like? Like I've seen

558
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:16,170
some images and things. It's
like a little similar to Lego in

559
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,690
terms of how you make it. But
like, how would you describe the

560
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,680
kids? Yeah, so

561
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:24,570
Dan Mantz: let's talk about VRC.
First, so VRC is metal parts.

562
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,080
I've always described it as,
yeah, this is for high school.

563
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,900
And you know, a lot of eighth
grade seventh and eighth grade

564
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,080
teams that have been doing Vex
for a long time. They'll they'll

565
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,860
also do VRC. So those are metal
parts with bigger motors. And I

566
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,280
think I described them as an
erector set. So I think as its

567
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,180
generations get older, it's
maybe people know what Erector

568
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,930
sets, but those are metal pieces
that they can be cut in and bent

569
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:54,300
and stuff like that. The Middle
School in late elementary the

570
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,300
Audrow Nash: IQ is like a
modular design where you'll have

571
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,550
a piece and it has a bunch of
holes in it. And then you can

572
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:03,060
insert something in and then you
can exactly anything to that. So

573
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,270
from

574
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,210
Dan Mantz: the metal pieces
you're using fasteners for for

575
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:11,040
IQ and Mexico you're using pins,
and the pins index go that's the

576
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,730
third fourth grade, the pins are
larger and easier to take in and

577
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:18,360
out. So IQ. Um, there's a lot
more parts, but that's exactly

578
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,210
what they are. There are parts
that you can put pins in,

579
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,530
there's different sizes. I don't
think, you know, some people say

580
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,700
like Lego, but the connection is
so much different. And the IQ

581
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,310
parts honestly stay together a
lot better, right, you can

582
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,930
actually build so if you do
Lego, you know, you're not

583
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:39,990
really running into stuff and
stuff like that you're more it's

584
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,930
more like a programming
challenge versus IQ. These

585
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,840
robots need to be a lot more
robust, so and the motors are

586
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,840
more stronger. There's a lot
more mechanisms. One of the

587
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,810
things I always ask subjects to
do every six months is release

588
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:55,440
new sensors. So as someone who's
come from industrial robotics

589
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:58,650
sensors are everything to me.
And that's the other beauty of

590
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:02,880
all of our programs they can Um,
with sensors, cameras, color

591
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,260
sensors, potentiometers, etc. So
it's, you know, you have to make

592
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,800
sure that your electronics are
robust enough to do the sensors

593
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,040
and stuff like that. But that's
the best way to teach coding to

594
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,550
is when you include sensors, and
you make sure that your game you

595
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:21,750
can win, you can play the game
without having sensors, but

596
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,120
you'll do better if you
integrate sensors. And that's

597
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:28,350
really, really important to me.
Is that, that students that are

598
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,360
learning this Learn sensors,
too.

599
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,870
Audrow Nash: So how do they so
if a student has a robot,

600
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:37,500
they've put it together? It has
motors, and it has a whole suite

601
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,010
of sensors that it can access?
How do they program it?

602
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,310
Dan Mantz: Well, one of the
things that Vex has done an

603
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:48,840
amazing job is they have Vex
code, and you get Vex code for

604
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,070
free. And I do want to say
there's third party programs out

605
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,830
there, like pros and stuff like
that, that you can use to but

606
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,250
for the simplicity, we'll just
talk about flex code. So a lot

607
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:03,510
of our students start with
blocks. And then they transition

608
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:07,350
into text based programming, you
know, it's looks very much like

609
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,180
C or you know, or something like
that. So, you know, it's, but

610
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,620
most of the most time students
will start with block coding,

611
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,770
and when they're comfortable,
they switch to text coding. And

612
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:23,670
it's, and then you have lots of
libraries that you can bring in.

613
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,570
And with the advanced
programming and our programs are

614
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:31,770
amazing. And same with with cat
two, even though teams start

615
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:36,090
with a kit of parts, our high
school teams, over 75% of our

616
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,420
high school teams CAD up their
robot and cat the parts too. So

617
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,990
you start at the very basic
level and early elementary

618
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:46,860
school. And it's a continuum,
you just continue to progress.

619
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,060
It's awesome.

620
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,420
Audrow Nash: For the coding. So
we have the block language that

621
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,400
kind of looks like Scratch, I
think.

622
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,330
Dan Mantz: Yeah, I think I think
that's safe to say that it's it

623
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:01,020
looks like Scratch, right? And
then as you move on from blocks,

624
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,410
then it looks like Python and c
plus plus.

625
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,310
Audrow Nash: Okay. I imagine
like a little subset of it

626
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,260
because C++ can be quite
complex.

627
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,740
Dan Mantz: Yeah, I can. It's
it's a simpler version of C++.

628
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,880
But as someone who used to be a
professional programmer, I think

629
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,510
that it's a good subset, you can
do some really good subset, I

630
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,420
feel very comfortable that
students that are programming

631
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:29,340
are robots with the C Plus Plus
and Python will be able to

632
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:32,460
transition that skill set
outside of robotics.

633
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,310
Audrow Nash: How do you so for
both of these, these are kind of

634
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:40,710
both your custom things? How do
you? How do you decide to make

635
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:44,370
it? I mean, so you're a team of
50 people with 30 additional

636
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:47,670
people as part time, how do you
decide to go make your own

637
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:51,810
programming languages as opposed
to like using Scratch, or using

638
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,140
Arduino or using something that
exists out there

639
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,420
Dan Mantz: the difference
between us as the not for profit

640
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,840
and then Vex as a product
company? So okay, so VEX

641
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,790
Robotics is one of the leading
education, STEM education

642
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:10,290
companies in the world, right?
So we just take their, their

643
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,350
products that they develop,
right, so we collaborate with

644
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:18,600
them, we explain what we see the
needs, but but Vex themselves

645
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,710
has an incredible resource of
mechanical electrical engineers

646
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,250
and programmers so so it's Vex
that actually develops the

647
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,600
hardware, develops the motors
and develops all the coding

648
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,280
resources. So Vax has a division
Vex education in Pittsburgh, and

649
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,700
they provide some of the best
products are as for example, I

650
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,390
would highly encourage the
people listening today or

651
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:47,430
watching today to look at Vex
code, and virtual robots VR,

652
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:51,180
there's free resources out there
that are absolutely incredible.

653
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,310
And again, they're free
resources. And these are

654
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:58,740
designed to for the education
market, right? So Vex is there

655
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,430
in classrooms across the world.
And so we're focused on the

656
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:06,270
competition piece. So again, I
always remind people index does

657
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:09,390
the same thing. They're a
product company. Their goal is

658
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,930
to make money and sell products.
And we're a not for profit that

659
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:17,220
runs competition, and camps and
education activities. And we

660
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,010
have the same thing at our
drones too. So we have partners

661
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:24,510
for our drones, competition,
that design and make drones. And

662
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,930
then we take the drone partners
and we integrate them into a

663
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,470
competition and education
curriculum. Gotcha. When

664
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,810
Audrow Nash: you're making a
competition and you are

665
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:37,740
selecting the robots to use how
closely do you work with Vex to

666
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,290
kind of get the parts prepared
and get the kids

667
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:44,670
Dan Mantz: question and we
actually on the game design

668
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:49,680
committee. It's actually half
Vex half REC foundation. So it's

669
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,520
100% cooperation, right? So we
go in there from the perspective

670
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,940
of our event partners, our
coaches, our students, what they

671
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,000
need, what parents need, with
the rules, and more importantly,

672
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,420
Are we going to be able to
support the competition? So

673
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,960
that's, that's what are our big
contribution on the Vex side?

674
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,620
You know, they have the
engineers and the programmers,

675
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,290
and that's what they contribute.
So it's a truly collaborative

676
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:16,680
effort. And we always design our
games two years ahead of time,

677
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,070
right. So the game that we're
going to reveal in March, and

678
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,580
May, has been designed already
for a year, and it's been

679
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,880
totaled up and the parks are in
the warehouse, and we already

680
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,410
have the game ready for 2023.
Right? So we'll start working on

681
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,660
the 2024 game very, very soon.

682
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:37,290
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So being
two years ahead, does that mean

683
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,530
you do like small groups of
students that are approximately

684
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,950
the age you're looking for? And
you like, run it by them? And

685
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:46,740
have them try it? Or, like early
feedback? Or

686
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,500
Dan Mantz: what do you guys we
don't, they're glad that the

687
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,350
students from our programs that
were listening would say, Man,

688
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:56,670
please do that, please do it. At
this point, security is very,

689
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:00,960
very key. Because when we
announce our new game, and may,

690
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,960
you know, competitions will
start happening, you know, a

691
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:08,940
month later, and Singapore and
Australia, etc. But we have to

692
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,720
be very, very sensitive about
keeping the game private,

693
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,770
because it is a competition. And
so we actually keep the circle

694
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:20,220
pretty small, that's aware of
the game. So some some people

695
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,630
from the RSAF will, will play
it, you know, simulate it. Same

696
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:28,470
with some of the Vex engineers,
but we actually don't do any pre

697
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:32,220
testing. We also try to be
flexible, just like we want our

698
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:36,330
students to be flexible. So for
example, last year's game, the

699
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:42,510
IQ game where one month into the
season, basically, we you have

700
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,880
you can lift yourself up at the
end, it's called the end game,

701
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,580
you can lift yourself up for
points, and we didn't have a

702
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:51,540
possession limit. And so teams
just filled up and then they

703
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,990
lifted and dumped. And they were
maxing out the game one month

704
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:58,380
into the season. So that's where
we evolve and stuff like that.

705
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,610
We're like, Okay, if you're in
the air, you can only possess X

706
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:06,000
amount of product, right? So,
but for the most part, we try to

707
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,320
do all our scenarios, the person
who leads the GDC, the game

708
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,560
design committee, he's very
meticulous, and looking at all

709
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,110
the what if scenarios, and for
the most part, we get it right.

710
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,800
And if we make a mistake, we
acknowledge it, we make a rule

711
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,790
and we give, we send out rule
updates, at least every couple

712
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:27,450
months throughout the season for
clarification. A lot of times we

713
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:30,450
do that, for the benefit of our
referees, the referees have a

714
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:33,660
very difficult job, especially
at the high school level, right?

715
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,280
So we're always evolving to make
sure that we're clear on our

716
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:38,970
rules.

717
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,250
Audrow Nash: By at the high
school level, is it especially

718
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:41,850
difficult,

719
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,900
Dan Mantz: I believe that it's
just more competitive, I think

720
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:50,010
teams, the bell curve I talked
to there's more students at the

721
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:53,970
high school that are motivated
to win, you know, so I think you

722
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,550
know, the earlier like, you
know, these kids that are at

723
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,800
second and third, they're
playing, and they're just having

724
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,960
fun, and they're learning stem,
and they're learning soft

725
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,810
skills, and they don't care
about winning or losing. But the

726
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,600
older you get, the more
important winning and losing is.

727
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,230
So I think our our, our high
school students are a little

728
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:14,310
more crafty about finding the
loopholes in our roles. So and I

729
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,490
mean, that affectionally to you
students out there, but they're

730
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:22,680
definitely better at identifying
and the loopholes and taking

731
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,220
advantage of

732
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:28,530
Audrow Nash: those. That's so
funny. Okay, and you mentioned,

733
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:32,130
you mentioned a couple of times
drones and the whole set of

734
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:35,190
drone competitions. How does
that fit? Or how does that fit

735
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,660
with everything? Yeah,

736
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,840
Dan Mantz: so you know, a few
years ago, I love mobile

737
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,110
robotics. And we'll talk about
my background a little bit

738
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:46,590
later, but I come from from
robotics, industrial robotics.

739
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,800
But when I joined the REC
Foundation, when the board asked

740
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:55,050
me to join as the CEO, there's a
couple things that I asked for.

741
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:58,230
I said, I'll take the position,
but I want to be able to move

742
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:01,080
outside of just stem, I want us
to focus on workforce

743
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,140
development. And I think there's
a large set of students that

744
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,440
aren't doing mobile robotics for
different reasons. And I want to

745
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,280
try to reach those students too.
And when you look about a drone

746
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,610
technology is everywhere. I'm a
country boy, myself, and you

747
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,150
know, drones are used in
agriculture for identifying, you

748
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:20,700
know, fields that have bug
infestations, or need more

749
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,600
watering or need less watering.
And drones are fun, and a lot of

750
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,560
people love flying them. So we
dipped our toe into drones about

751
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,140
three and a half years ago. And
I think a lot of people honestly

752
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,140
were skeptical. They weren't
sure that I was making a good

753
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,860
decision there. But I just felt
that mobile robotics aren't for

754
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,960
everybody. And by mobile

755
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,230
Audrow Nash: robotics, you mean
ground robots? Yes. Drive

756
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:43,740
around.

757
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,770
Dan Mantz: Exactly. The ones
with wheels are true thank

758
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:50,340
tread, etc. And so there's a
whole group of students that

759
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:54,090
maybe weren't going to do STEM.
They weren't going to analysis

760
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:58,020
because it's fun to fly a drone.
So now they start programming a

761
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,780
drone and they add sensors to
the trunk. Under, they build the

762
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,680
drone. And they're getting that
same skill set that you get in

763
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,730
the ground based robotics. And
so that's why we did it. And,

764
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,510
and then for our our V five
workcell, our factory automation

765
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:16,080
competition, same thing,
students out there, they're not

766
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,710
going into engineering, they may
not have the financial, you

767
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:24,240
know, ability to do it, they may
not have the background, and

768
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,970
they want or they just may not
like, you know, school, right,

769
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:31,410
so, but they need good, good
jobs, too. And robotics is the

770
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:34,410
fastest growing industry, right?
There's robotics everywhere. So

771
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:37,710
we didn't know develop, we
developed a program where

772
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:41,550
students, they build a robot
that looks a lot like a factory

773
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:45,300
automation, an industrial robot,
they build conveyor systems, and

774
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,500
they figure out how to make the
robots work and how to

775
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:54,960
collaboratively stack cargo and
by color, sort by color and

776
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,500
stuff like that. So we felt it
was really important to reach

777
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:02,850
all the students that we need so
desperately for our workforce.

778
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,840
Audrow Nash: Why do you? So I
mean, I know that there's labor

779
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,960
shortages, and I know that we
have an aging population. And

780
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,380
there's a lot of other things.
But why do you? Why do you say

781
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,400
that the last statement?

782
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:17,789
Dan Mantz: Well, I mean, just
even Department of Defense and

783
00:46:17,789 --> 00:46:21,509
Department of Workforce studies.
Now we have a gap. You know,

784
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:25,019
even a couple years ago, there
was 2 million more STEM jobs

785
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:28,169
being created every year than we
had people to fill them. And

786
00:46:28,169 --> 00:46:31,019
when I say stem, I'm not talking
engineers and scientists, I'm

787
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:34,439
talking robot technicians,
people that are doing technical

788
00:46:34,439 --> 00:46:38,129
jobs in the workforce, because
even in retail, now, there are

789
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:41,669
technical jobs, you know, you go
into WalMart, you see the robots

790
00:46:41,669 --> 00:46:44,669
that are doing inventory and
stocking and you need people to

791
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:48,959
maintain those. So technology is
permeating themselves in all

792
00:46:48,959 --> 00:46:52,169
industries right now. So those
jobs are growing much faster

793
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:56,339
than non technical jobs. I mean,
they're growing 30% faster. And

794
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:59,429
there's a huge gap of people
that have the talents to use

795
00:46:59,429 --> 00:47:02,609
these to do these jobs. And
that's the challenge that we're

796
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:05,459
trying to face. Of course, we
want the next generation of

797
00:47:05,459 --> 00:47:08,519
scientists and engineers and
technicians, I don't want to

798
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:11,699
minimize that. But we also have
so many students that didn't,

799
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:16,079
the good paying jobs out there
are maintaining the robot on the

800
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:21,449
factory floor are tweaking the
inventory robots at a retail

801
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:26,579
store, they are the ones setting
up the cameras, so that, you

802
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:29,039
know they can do better
scanning, and those don't

803
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:32,429
necessarily have to have college
degrees to do these jobs. But

804
00:47:32,429 --> 00:47:36,029
you do need to have a technical
aptitude. So that's a gap that

805
00:47:36,029 --> 00:47:38,849
the US government has
identified, it's that gap exists

806
00:47:38,849 --> 00:47:42,299
everywhere in the world is that
tech jobs are growing so much

807
00:47:42,299 --> 00:47:45,689
faster than non tech jobs. And
we need our students to have

808
00:47:45,689 --> 00:47:47,519
those skills to fill these jobs.

809
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:55,350
Audrow Nash: So it's from I
guess, this is kind of a big

810
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:59,310
picture perspective, where
you're trying to think of where

811
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:02,940
the world will be in the future,
and you're trying to make it so

812
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,460
that this knee that keeps
growing, that we can kind of

813
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:10,770
match it by exposing more people
to robotics, getting them

814
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:15,540
interested, even if it's at a
much even if it's not like PhD

815
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:20,940
in robotics, or like a leak
researcher or robotics engineer,

816
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:21,600
but

817
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,640
Dan Mantz: I think your your
audience has probably heard of,

818
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,000
you know, the industry 4.0 the
fourth industrial revolution,

819
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,350
right, that it's, yeah, it's
rapid technology and stuff like

820
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:37,440
that. And that's where we are
right now. And, you know, I like

821
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,050
to think at the Rec Foundation,
we were slightly ahead of the

822
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:44,520
curve as far as developing
programs for the fourth

823
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,780
industrial revolution, right for
industry 4.0. But it's not in

824
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,020
the future anymore. It's here
now smack smart factories are

825
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:56,580
here. Now, artificial
intelligence is here. Now, you

826
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,730
know, data learning is here.
Now, all those things are here,

827
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:03,420
there when you when you type in
something in your search bar,

828
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:08,070
and all sudden it does a profile
on you. Those are technology

829
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:13,380
jobs, that is the industry 4.0.
And, you know, and so we need to

830
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,440
make sure that we're not
preparing students for the

831
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,900
future jobs, we're preparing
them for the jobs that are here

832
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,900
now. And it's just going to tend
to continue to grow. And again,

833
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,500
it's not just factories, it's
just not manufacturing. It's

834
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,580
agriculture. For example, I
mean, if you've ever gone into a

835
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,250
dairy farm, and I've been to
many, many dairy farms growing

836
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,640
up in rural Pennsylvania, they
have some of the most advanced

837
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,310
technology and it's been there
forever. I mean, they would, you

838
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:41,370
know, or the cows are being fed,
right, you know, or how's the

839
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:44,940
quality of the milk and stuff
like that? And of course,

840
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,180
military, right. That's the
military's high tech now, and

841
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:53,670
we're very, very proud that the
junior JROTC army JROTC chose

842
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:57,690
the REC foundation to be one of
their partners. And it's not

843
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:02,040
about people joining charity
See, as engineers, it's about

844
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,670
these students building our
robots programming our robots,

845
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:09,780
building our job, drones, flying
our drones, they're just giving

846
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,380
them the basic skill set. So
when these students enlist in

847
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,710
the military, they have the
skill sets to use the modern

848
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:20,580
tanks and, and to do all that
type of stuff. It's we're here

849
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,880
now industry 4.0 is here now.
And we're just one of many

850
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,220
organizations out there that are
trying to make sure that our

851
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,640
students are ready. And I think
that, because of our model, we

852
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,900
keep prices affordable and
accessible. And I think we have

853
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,270
a really, really good model,
which is why we're growing so

854
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:36,810
quickly.

855
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:42,120
Audrow Nash: What what
explicitly in terms of skills

856
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:47,040
and like, how explicitly do you
see the REC program,

857
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,640
contributing to preparing people
for the jobs you were

858
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,090
mentioning, like maybe setting
up a camera or whatever it might

859
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:54,390
be.

860
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:57,780
Dan Mantz: So I do think in our
program, you learned some hands

861
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,020
on tech skills. I do, I think,
you know, you'd learn

862
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:05,550
programming, you learn, you
know, without even know you're

863
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,430
learning math, you're learning
about gear ratios, and torque

864
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:10,680
and some of those things. So
you're learning some, some

865
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:14,430
technical skills, but what our
program really, really does, in

866
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:17,130
my opinion, and many programs
like ours is we're really

867
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:20,550
teaching the soft skills. And
you hear more and more people

868
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:24,090
talking about the soft skills,
but our data shows that students

869
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:26,700
coming out of the program to the
soft skills. So let me step back

870
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,740
and say what that is. So
students that are in our

871
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:32,460
program, really learn how to
communicate, to be successful in

872
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,460
our programming, you have to
communicate with your teammates,

873
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,380
you have to communicate to your
coach and you have to

874
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,930
communicate with the teams
you're playing against a force.

875
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,650
So you learn communication, you
learn problem solving, and

876
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:46,290
troubleshooting. I mean, that's
a skill set. No matter what you

877
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:50,010
do. In our program, you are
learning how to troubleshoot and

878
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:54,510
to solve problems. And I think
that's really, really clear. And

879
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,460
you're and you're learning the
perseverance, and you're

880
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,880
learning patience. So all these
skills aren't necessarily

881
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,970
technical skills, but they're
what employers really, really

882
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:06,480
want. I myself, I used to hire
lots of engineers, I didn't

883
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,500
always hire the engineer that
had the highest GPA. I hired

884
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,140
engineers that were good
communicators and good problem

885
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,810
solvers, because I could teach
them the tech skills, right? I

886
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:18,840
could teach them that. But I
really had a harder time

887
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,600
teaching people how to
communicate and troubleshoot and

888
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:26,370
stuff like that. So I feel with
with very strong confidence, and

889
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:29,340
the data shows that the the
universities that study our

890
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,940
students, the data shows that
students in our programs come

891
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,880
out with advanced soft skills,
they really are good

892
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,310
troubleshooters, good
communicators good problem

893
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,060
solvers.

894
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,300
Audrow Nash: Yeah, it's funny to
me, it's almost ironic, in a

895
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:46,740
sense that it's the whole, the
mission is to increase stem

896
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:51,360
engagement. And then the big
outcome is increasing soft

897
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:56,190
skills, which is not exactly
stem to me, but very, very

898
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:56,730
important.

899
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,690
Dan Mantz: Yeah, that's actually
very insightful. And four and a

900
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:02,640
half years of doing these,
you're the first person that's

901
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,550
pointed those out, and
internally, my own staff has

902
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:09,270
actually stepped back and, and I
do think you'll see us tweak

903
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:12,660
our, our mission and vision to
emphasize that more. And there's

904
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,170
a lot of other robotics
organizations out there. You

905
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:19,320
know, I joke that we're the
largest, but we're not the best

906
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,910
known. But I would say that all
the other robotics organizations

907
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:27,450
out there would all say that the
STEM skills is what the students

908
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:30,390
get most from our program. I
mean, literally, the data is in

909
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:33,270
the 90%. You know, you talk to
coaches, you talk to parents,

910
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:38,460
you talk to employers, and, you
know, 90% of our students have

911
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:41,970
good communication skills, you
know, 97% demonstrate problem

912
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:48,420
solving. It's the data is
remarkable. And we can teach a

913
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,690
lot of the skills, but we giving
them that infrastructure, that

914
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:54,660
foundation of the good problem
solving and communication skills

915
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:58,680
are so important. And again, I
don't want to hand wave. You

916
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,380
know, I joke how many students
in our program, learn about four

917
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,740
bar link systems and gear ratios
and torque, they do learn

918
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:08,760
technical stuff, too. And, you
know, and then if you do drones,

919
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:10,950
if you're in any one of our
drones, programs, you're

920
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:14,640
learning a lot about physics and
aerodynamics, and lift and stuff

921
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,810
like that, too. So

922
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,860
Audrow Nash: yeah, definitely.
Not too. Well, kind of to play

923
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:24,090
devil's devil's advocate, but
not to, I don't know, just just

924
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:28,950
out of curiosity, is robotics
the best way to teach these soft

925
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,490
skills? Or why is it well suited
for this? That's kind of like

926
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:36,690
one of the big underlying value
adds of this kind of structure?

927
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:39,060
Dan Mantz: Yeah, you know, and I
have been asked that question

928
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:42,750
before. And, first of all,
you'll never hear me say

929
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,330
robotics is the only way to do
it. I mean, if I would have felt

930
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:47,760
that way, we wouldn't have
started drones programs, and we

931
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,790
wouldn't started our factory
automation competition, right.

932
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:54,420
So there are other programs, but
I think the reason that robotics

933
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,600
is so effective, and the reason
that there's other robotics

934
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:02,040
programs out there, is because
you Start with a concept. You

935
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,170
have a challenge that you're
trying to meet, and you start

936
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:08,430
with a concept. So then you
design and you build. But then

937
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,880
you start competing. And whether
you're competing with somebody

938
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,160
to score points, or whether
you're competing against

939
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,030
somebody to truly win and lose,
the big brings up the fun part.

940
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,030
And I think sometimes we don't
talk about the fun part. And

941
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:24,000
that's why robotics is so it's
so effective at doing this,

942
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,670
because it's a lot of fun. If
you go to a robotics

943
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:30,030
competition, kids are dancing
and laughing and making friends

944
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:33,840
and stuff like that. So. So
that's why I think robotics is

945
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,260
is one of the great platforms to
teach these skills. It's not the

946
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,960
only one out there, though, I
think people that tells you that

947
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,170
it is aren't being genuine. But
I do think it's one of the good

948
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:46,020
ones. And honestly, with the REC
Foundation, our price models

949
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:50,310
good too. And we offer all the
educator resources for free. If

950
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:53,490
you go to our website, and you
want to know how to teach gear

951
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:57,060
ratios, we have stem labs
available for the teachers to

952
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:00,540
learn this. And really night.
And so that's really, really

953
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,570
important is to make sure that
the entry level I mean, we have

954
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:07,560
what we call educator training.
And it's not to teach the

955
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:12,390
teachers to become roboticist.
Right? It's to help them get

956
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:16,080
over the intimidation factor. So
the not afraid of it, right. So,

957
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,590
you know, in our program, the
teachers really just need to be

958
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:22,650
facilitators, because the
students will embrace the

959
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,790
technology and, and students are
a genius, right? They go on to

960
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:30,570
YouTube. So if there's an early
season competition in China, or

961
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:34,170
Singapore and Australia, and
when school starts in the US in

962
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:37,200
mid August or early September,
these students have already

963
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,170
scoped out some of the good
robots from other countries. And

964
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:43,020
And honestly, people say, well,
don't you have a convergence of

965
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:47,010
design. And some of our games we
do to get convergence of design,

966
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:49,860
right, at the end of the year, a
lot of the robots look the same.

967
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,980
But that's real world, too. You
know, I've spent 21 years at

968
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:56,940
FANUC robotics and a six axis
robot that does palletizing, or

969
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,700
does welding or something like
that, they kind of look the

970
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,280
same. I mean, they look a little
bit different here and there.

971
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,250
It's what's behind the scenes.
It's the kinematics, and it's

972
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:09,420
the sensors and the speed that
really make the difference. So I

973
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,880
don't really care that much that
the robots start looking the

974
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:15,330
same after a year, it's real
life. But those students that

975
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:18,090
have figured out how to program
better and how to utilize their

976
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:21,090
sensors better, they're gonna
probably have the top performing

977
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:21,900
robots.

978
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:27,780
Audrow Nash: That's very
interesting. Yeah. How do you so

979
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,700
can you tell me a bit about the
pandemic, and like how you use

980
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,880
simulation, and all of this?
Yeah, so

981
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:40,260
Dan Mantz: so we made a decision
during the pandemic, that we

982
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:43,710
weren't just going to become
virtual. Now Vex did an

983
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:48,570
incredible job, developing
virtual resources, their Vex

984
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:52,530
code, and teaching kids how to
program and their virtual

985
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:55,530
robotics that they gave to the
community, we're free, we're

986
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:59,970
amazing. That was for so many
teachers for, you know, hundreds

987
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:03,330
of 1000s of teachers out there.
And for the millions of students

988
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:06,030
that learn how to program during
the pandemic, because the

989
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:11,190
virtual, that was a lifesaver.
But at the Rec Foundation, we

990
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:15,510
firmly believe that hands on as
part of our program, it's not

991
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:18,030
just virtual. And there's a lot
of companies out there that have

992
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,640
transitioned or like you can
virtually build a robot or a

993
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,390
drone, and compete virtually,
but we actually believe the

994
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:27,720
design process, which includes
building a robot and includes

995
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:31,470
using the tools, using your
hands, putting things together

996
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:35,070
things breaking is vital. So
while we offered virtual

997
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:38,970
programs, we really went for a
remote strategy. And since so

998
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:42,000
many, you know, we when you have
a program as large as we do,

999
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:46,080
there's Vex parts all over the
world, right? So teachers found

1000
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,260
a way to get the parts to their
students, and they built robots,

1001
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:52,290
and we connected them, you know,
you did have to have a field.

1002
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,890
But we also made it very simple
Do It Yourself field that you

1003
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:59,850
could build with plywood, you
know, and, and then you needed a

1004
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:03,990
camera. But most laptops have a
camera and we basically develop

1005
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:07,320
the infrastructure to connect
these. So one of my favorite

1006
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,200
things in my entire career.
Definitely one of my favorite

1007
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:16,140
parts about 2021 was we had live
remote Vex worlds. So we're

1008
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:19,170
still at the point of the
pandemic where people couldn't

1009
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:21,990
get together and large. So we
had a lot of in person state

1010
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:25,050
championships even during the
pandemic, but we couldn't have

1011
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:29,010
effects worlds with 1000s and
1000s of teams and 10s of 1000s

1012
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:32,670
of students, right. So we did
this live remote technology. And

1013
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:36,120
one of my favorite days is I was
watching a match. And we have

1014
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,630
this big screen setup and we had
six divisions and in the

1015
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:44,100
divisions we had like I think it
was 16 Different countries

1016
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:48,540
represented. So you saw a team
in China playing a team in Texas

1017
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:52,920
and a team from Japan, a team
from the UK, and where the

1018
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:56,100
fields were set up was amazing.
We had field setup in bedrooms,

1019
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,520
we had field setup and empty
libraries. We had field setup

1020
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,910
and Hall Ways we had a field set
up in the outside tent, New

1021
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:05,490
England where they weren't
allowed to have indoor events in

1022
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:09,450
basements and garages and in
some traditional schools, too,

1023
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:12,810
right? So, and here we are all
these teams were still playing

1024
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:15,780
with and against each other
because we decided to do it

1025
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,400
remotely and not virtually.

1026
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,840
Audrow Nash: That's so cool.
What do you so

1027
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,130
Dan Mantz: I agree with you, but

1028
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:27,000
Audrow Nash: why hands on? Like,
what's the, what's the big

1029
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,930
reason for that?

1030
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:32,190
Dan Mantz: I, you know, that's,
I probably need to get some data

1031
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:34,620
behind this too, although I know
we have. And I just don't have

1032
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:38,640
it handy right here. But I think
the hands on reinforces the

1033
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,540
learning. So it's easy to say,
Okay, I'm going to put two

1034
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:46,260
different gears together for
speed or torque or power, and

1035
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:49,560
you do it in software, or you do
it in CAD and stuff like that.

1036
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:52,740
And you see it that way, versus
when you actually do it on a

1037
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,650
real robot and you put them
together, and then you change a

1038
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:59,580
gear, and it goes faster or
slower, it's stronger. So I

1039
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:02,190
think it demonstrates what
you're learning in the

1040
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:05,790
classroom. I don't think, you
know, project based learning is

1041
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:08,970
fundamentally what I believe on
hands on learning, because you

1042
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:11,310
can learn it in the classroom.
And then when you do, it

1043
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:12,750
reinforces what you learn.

1044
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:17,100
Audrow Nash: Yeah, I totally
agree. I think from from my

1045
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:20,160
perspective, like one of the
reasons I really liked

1046
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,130
programming is because I can try
things very quickly. And I can

1047
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:27,360
immediately see where my idea is
not complete. But I think that

1048
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,480
that took a while of learning
how to program. But if you're

1049
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,820
playing with gears and things,
or you're trying different

1050
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:36,150
things, you can immediately see
if the results are working. Like

1051
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,790
if it's doing what you expect,
and if not, it's a great

1052
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:42,180
opportunity for learning. So
intuitively, it seems to me that

1053
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:45,960
hands on is probably the best
way for learning and probably

1054
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:50,850
the best way for getting
everyone involved. Because the

1055
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:53,280
results kind of speak for
themselves. And it's not that

1056
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,090
you have to follow an abstract
programming language that is

1057
01:01:57,090 --> 01:02:01,320
hard to understand for people
who are beginning. So physical

1058
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,190
makes sense to me.

1059
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:05,010
Dan Mantz: Yeah, I absolutely
agree with you. And, and, you

1060
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:07,380
know, coding is a great way
because I actually started my

1061
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:09,840
career as a controls engineer.
So I've done a lot of

1062
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:14,760
programming myself. And in our
program, we have the autonomous

1063
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,440
so even in our, our elementary
programs, we don't start the

1064
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,010
matches with autonomous but we
have a programming factor like

1065
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:27,030
so one minute, it's 100%
programming based, but what a

1066
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:30,000
great way to learn programming,
you build your robot and say,

1067
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,590
You need to go, you know, shoot
some balls without driving it,

1068
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:37,740
right. So you learn a sensor,
you scoop up the ball, and you

1069
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:43,200
shoot it right. And the fact of
a developing your mechanism is

1070
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,620
the mechanical spa. And the
electrical is the sensor, but

1071
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:50,040
the programming is is how you
make it all work together. And

1072
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,790
whether you just say, go forward
for this distance or go forward

1073
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:56,940
at this or whether you actually
use the sensors. It's an

1074
01:02:56,970 --> 01:03:01,500
iterative programming, and I
think the programming skill set

1075
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,810
from our students is the one
area I've seen the most

1076
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:08,220
advancement, that the skill set
of programming from four years

1077
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:11,100
ago when I first joined the REC
Foundation, that's the biggest

1078
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:12,540
area of increase I've seen.

1079
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:17,940
Audrow Nash: That's so
interesting. Yeah. So one thing

1080
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:22,830
that I haven't heard much in the
whole program is any, like open

1081
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:27,180
source related things or use
have, you mentioned that you

1082
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:31,020
have libraries involved with the
coding, but I imagine that

1083
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:34,500
they're developed buybacks, or
it's kind of like a closed

1084
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,340
source kind of.

1085
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:39,119
Dan Mantz: And so you know, our
program tends to be a little bit

1086
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,549
more closed source. But that
doesn't mean we don't have open

1087
01:03:41,549 --> 01:03:44,339
source libraries is a good
example, the community will,

1088
01:03:44,609 --> 01:03:48,659
will develop libraries and share
them. And that's a good example,

1089
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:52,589
open source on CAD designs, for
example, and some things like

1090
01:03:52,589 --> 01:03:57,299
that, but we're not giving out
the the designs of the motor so

1091
01:03:57,299 --> 01:04:00,539
that you can design your own
motor, for example. And we do

1092
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:06,539
that for very practical reasons.
One is level playing field. And

1093
01:04:06,539 --> 01:04:10,109
so many stem competitions, the
more money you have, the better

1094
01:04:10,109 --> 01:04:13,559
you're going to do. And by
everybody starting with the same

1095
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:17,249
parts, it does level the playing
field. Now I'm not naive, if you

1096
01:04:17,249 --> 01:04:21,359
have more funds, you can buy
more motors, more sensors, build

1097
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,209
more iterative designs and stuff
like that. And you're probably

1098
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:26,849
going to, at the end of the
season, maybe have a better

1099
01:04:26,849 --> 01:04:32,039
robot, but the concept of using
one manufacturer's product

1100
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:35,669
really does level. The other
thing is it keeps the cost. It

1101
01:04:35,669 --> 01:04:38,639
really, really keeps the costs
down because we're talking

1102
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:43,079
volume here, right? So if every
robot out there is using eight

1103
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:47,279
of the same motor, and we have
30,000 teams, you're mass

1104
01:04:47,279 --> 01:04:51,479
producing those motors if it's
open source, you know it's true,

1105
01:04:51,479 --> 01:04:54,809
you might have somebody comes up
with a lower cost motor for one

1106
01:04:54,809 --> 01:04:58,169
application, but overall, it's
going to be a more expensive

1107
01:04:58,169 --> 01:05:00,479
product by the end of the season
and there's a lot A lot of

1108
01:05:00,629 --> 01:05:03,629
robotics competitions out there,
they're, they're open source,

1109
01:05:03,629 --> 01:05:06,269
and they say it's cheaper. But
when you talk to the teams, they

1110
01:05:06,299 --> 01:05:08,249
ultimately spend way more money
in the

1111
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:13,620
Audrow Nash: interesting. I
would wonder also, just, and

1112
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:17,550
maybe this is the students being
a little too young for this kind

1113
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:21,030
of thing, but I feel free to
really get a lot done, it's very

1114
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:26,040
useful to understand how to work
in kind of, in the open source

1115
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,670
software world, where you can go
and grab this one thing, learn

1116
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:31,770
about it quickly, and then
integrate it into what you're

1117
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:33,930
doing, and then grow, but grab
this other thing, and you can

1118
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:40,950
see the value of testing and all
of the my Siri going off all of

1119
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:46,170
the, it's just there's a lot
that is very useful to learn

1120
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:49,410
there. That's very practical, I
think. And I wonder if that

1121
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:51,720
would be something that'd be
useful to fold into the

1122
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,280
education for the students.

1123
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:56,250
Dan Mantz: And I think we have
that with libraries already.

1124
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:59,490
Right. So, you know, a lot of
times the people that are

1125
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:02,400
providing libraries are just
providing a compiled version,

1126
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,550
and maybe not the open source,
build on what to do, right. But

1127
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:10,920
at the end of the day, you know,
with Vex code, you can develop

1128
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,200
in blocks, and then you can
switch it, you can actually

1129
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,410
switch it over to text and see
how the code works. And to me,

1130
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:19,680
there's no better way to learn
programming, I wish I would have

1131
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,100
had that in the 90s when I got
started, right? So back then it

1132
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,920
was pseudo code, right? You did
pseudo code, and then you wrote

1133
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:31,050
code behind it? Well, you can
pull in a library. And if the

1134
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:35,220
source code is available, that
you can see how it works. And so

1135
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:38,400
yes, there's a practical reason
to use the Vex code, but you're

1136
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,550
still learning C plus, plus,
you're still learning the

1137
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:45,270
languages out there. Again, this
goes back to because I have

1138
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:48,420
these discussions a lot. And I
do understand both sides of the

1139
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:51,780
argument. But for our program,
it's the bell curve. And I

1140
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:56,190
remind educators, I remind my
staff all over again, it's like

1141
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:59,760
we're not appealing to the top
10%, we're trying to appeal to

1142
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,390
the entire bell curve, and
authority. I think the way the

1143
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:06,750
model of our program is actually
the most approachable and

1144
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:10,860
sustainable model for most
students. And, you know, my kids

1145
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,350
did robotics, I have four
children, three of the four did

1146
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:17,850
robotics. Two of them did Vex
and, and two of them did other

1147
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:22,380
programs, two that were had more
machining involved, for example,

1148
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:25,320
and stuff like that. And they
have the resources at their

1149
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:28,740
schools to do it. But they also
had much, much larger budgets.

1150
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:32,640
They had engineering mentors,
computer science mentors, our

1151
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,790
program is so that the teacher,
the classroom educator, or the

1152
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:40,350
parent can be the coach, and the
resources are free. So by having

1153
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:43,980
everybody start from the same
level playing field that really

1154
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:47,220
works better for reaching more
students, but I don't pretend

1155
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,820
that our program, you know, for
some of those very advanced

1156
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:54,450
competitions out there, that
we're offering that same level

1157
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:57,900
of engineering, I've never, you
know, pretend that we do again,

1158
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:01,560
but when you look at the 1
million students in our program,

1159
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:03,750
I think, reaching more students,

1160
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,350
Audrow Nash: definitely, yeah,
it makes sense. Because you're

1161
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:10,590
trying to basically supply the
most it's your it's your

1162
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:13,200
mission. You're trying to get
the most people interested in

1163
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,310
STEM, correct?

1164
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,520
Dan Mantz: Yeah, you just said
it for me. Thank you so much.

1165
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,050
Exactly. So it

1166
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:21,690
Audrow Nash: makes sense. Your
approach makes complete sense,

1167
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:24,960
given that mission, and it's
nice to see you guys be very

1168
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,600
mission driven. That that
informs a lot of your decisions.

1169
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:31,950
Yeah. So now, tell me a bit
about your background.

1170
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:37,860
Dan Mantz: Okay. Well, so I have
a lot of passion for world and

1171
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:41,040
underserved communities, because
I grew up in rural Pennsylvania.

1172
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:45,660
You know, I was, you know,
definitely solid middle class,

1173
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,570
but I grew up we had 30 acres,
you know, a lot of my neighbors

1174
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:52,860
had 10 Out 1520 acres, but I was
a country boy, my school was,

1175
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:57,030
you know, 18 miles away. I was
in a graduating class of 180.

1176
01:08:57,570 --> 01:09:01,350
But I was really good at math
and science. So I had a teacher

1177
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:04,320
that said, you should look at
going into engineering. I'm from

1178
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:07,260
other parts of Pennsylvania,
where Lee Iacocca and maybe much

1179
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:10,470
of your audience will know who
he was, but he ran Chrysler, he

1180
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:12,810
was at Ford and he went to
Chrysler, and he turned around

1181
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:17,070
Chrysler from bankruptcy. And,
and, but a lot of my friends

1182
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:19,860
that I grew up with that we
built dirt bikes, and tree forts

1183
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:22,650
and stuff like that. I went into
skilled trades, right? They

1184
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:26,760
went, they became machine tool
operators. They became HVAC

1185
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,550
technicians, they became diesel
mechanics, and I was the only

1186
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:34,170
one that really went to college.
So, at that point, I never felt

1187
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,540
that to have a successful
career, you had to have a four

1188
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:40,470
year degree. It just was I had
the aptitude and you know, my

1189
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:43,680
parents were able to help me out
some and so I went to college in

1190
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:47,400
Michigan, I went to at the time,
it was called GMI. It's now

1191
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:50,040
called Kettering University.
It's in Flint, Michigan, but it

1192
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,040
was a co op school and to this
day, it's the only full time Co

1193
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,760
Op university in the United what
does that mean? So it means that

1194
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,550
you would go to school for three
months and then you would work

1195
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:04,230
for or your sponsor, which in my
case was General Motors. You

1196
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:07,080
worked for three months. So you
did that for five years. So as a

1197
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:10,350
five year program, three months
of school, three months of work,

1198
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:12,810
it was year round. We used to
get a week off for Christmas and

1199
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:17,160
a week off in the summer. And so
yeah, I've been working, working

1200
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:21,660
in industry since I was before I
was 18 years old. But with the

1201
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:25,740
Co Op program, your freshman
year, right out of school, you

1202
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:28,320
don't have a lot of skills, but
you're already working with very

1203
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,920
professional engineers. And, and
you're with I worked for General

1204
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,520
Motors, CPC, Chevrolet, Pontiac,
the candidate division for my

1205
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,900
entire Co Op career, and I was
doing very advanced projects by

1206
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:44,730
the time I was a junior, and so
my junior senior and my thesis

1207
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:48,060
year, I was really, really
working on that stuff. So when I

1208
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:51,390
graduated GMI Kettering
graduates tend to get really

1209
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:54,600
good starting salaries because
we have so much work experience.

1210
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:59,640
And so but I was at GM and a
friend of mine was at FANUC. And

1211
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,520
he says fanic needs controls
engineers. I'm like, well,

1212
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,250
that's not my background, you
know? And he's like, Yeah, but

1213
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:08,250
you were like, the best coder in
our fraternity right? here that

1214
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:10,950
what everybody answered it. So
I'm like, Yeah, controls is a

1215
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:14,010
lot of coding. So I went to
FANUC. As a controls engineer, I

1216
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:18,090
traveled the world. I went to
factories and dozens of

1217
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:21,690
countries and learn control
systems. And, you know, you do

1218
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:24,540
that for seven years, we started
raising a family and my wife

1219
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:28,590
says, It's time to be home more.
I went into project and program

1220
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:31,560
management and started
developing the next generation

1221
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,590
of robotics. And I, you know, I
was fortunate enough to be on a

1222
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:38,220
couple of patterns. My, my
expertise was pneumatics,

1223
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:41,070
believe it or not, that was kind
of where I really thrive,

1224
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:45,060
controls and pneumatics. But I
did that for five years. And

1225
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:47,670
then I started doing the
management training. And so by

1226
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:51,450
the by 20th, year at FANUC, I
had been Director of Product

1227
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:54,840
Development for five years. So I
had mechanical engineers, and

1228
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:57,930
electrical engineers, they all
worked for me application

1229
01:11:57,930 --> 01:12:01,590
engineers, and we're developing
great, great things. And we were

1230
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:05,550
doing AI and we were learning
about collaborative robots. And

1231
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,100
but I was getting really tired.
You know, I did a lot of

1232
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:11,550
traveling, I've been to a lot of
factories, and a friend of mine

1233
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:14,970
was down in Texas. He said that
they were looking for a

1234
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:17,520
president of a company called
rack solutions. He said he

1235
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,940
thought it'd be a good fit. I
traveled to Texas, I got the

1236
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:26,370
job. And I went from high tech,
very advanced robotics, to sheet

1237
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:28,830
metal design and manufacturing.
But it was one of the best

1238
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:31,410
things that could have ever
happened to me. Because I

1239
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:33,840
realized how important
manufacturing, I mean, we always

1240
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,780
hear that impact, you know,
manufacturing is important and

1241
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:40,350
FANUC had initiative called Save
Our factory, that, you know, by

1242
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:42,750
using robots, you're actually
keeping the factories

1243
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:45,570
competitive, so that we can
compete against the, you know,

1244
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:48,540
the rest of the world. Well,
here I was in a sheet metal

1245
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:52,350
company competing against China
and Europe and stuff like that.

1246
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:55,650
So it was a great experience for
me, I started learning the

1247
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:59,070
business side, you know, p&l and
stuff like that. And I started

1248
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:00,870
coaching robotics. And

1249
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:06,300
so I started coaching robotics.
And my good friend was the

1250
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,180
president of VEX robotics. And
because people knew that we were

1251
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:12,750
friends, they started saying,
hey, go tell Paul, this, go tell

1252
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:16,020
Tony, this, go tell Bob this,
right. And so I kept going to

1253
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:19,680
those guys. And I kept saying
that, hey, this is some of the

1254
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:22,620
feedback we're getting from the
community. And finally, there

1255
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,360
were I think, I must have
frustrated, like, you need to

1256
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,750
join our board. So I joined the
board of the robotics education

1257
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:31,860
competition foundation, I dug in
really hard for six months,

1258
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:34,140
because you know, I've been
hearing with the community

1259
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,840
thought of it right. And I
thought we could do better. So

1260
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:40,260
after a couple of months, like I
gave a report to the board on

1261
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:43,080
things I thought we could do
better financially, and

1262
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:47,250
organizationally and product
wise. And the board asked if I

1263
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:51,870
would take over as CEO, and that
was five years ago, in June, so

1264
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:55,140
the first week of June, five
years ago. And it's been

1265
01:13:55,140 --> 01:14:00,000
fantastic. And as I started the
conversation, I was happy to

1266
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,030
take the job I had, you know, I
had my doubts because I'd never

1267
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:06,060
been for not for profit. But I
said I wanted to have the

1268
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:09,630
ability to work on workforce
development, not just be stem.

1269
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,290
And I wanted the ability to to
branch outside of just ground

1270
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:17,670
robots to and the board was kind
enough to say, Sure, go for it.

1271
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:19,860
If you have time, go for it. I
think they thought it'd be so

1272
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,830
busy with the VEX robotics
competitions. I wouldn't have

1273
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:26,850
time. But we've built up a
really good staff here and we've

1274
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:31,290
expanded so 21 years of
industrial robotics from from

1275
01:14:31,290 --> 01:14:34,830
the control side to product
development. And I've gone full

1276
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:38,850
circle to now robotics,
education and competitions.

1277
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:48,090
Audrow Nash: It's quite a path.
Yeah. How did so how do you? How

1278
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:55,200
do you see programs like yours,
like REC, helping, or how does

1279
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:58,440
it fit with the educational
program? In your mind?

1280
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:01,440
Dan Mantz: Yeah, I think we're
really Be very complimentary, I

1281
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:06,930
think, again, because of Vex,
and for the win and Dell, and so

1282
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:10,500
many of our other partners, they
developed curriculum content.

1283
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:16,050
But I firmly believe that to
reinforce what teachers are

1284
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:19,710
teaching in the classroom,
especially technology, pre

1285
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:23,850
engineering, physics, math, you
know, you can teach it in the

1286
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:25,980
classroom, but like we talked
about earlier, when you can

1287
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:28,650
demonstrate it and have hands
on, it reinforces it, and it

1288
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:31,980
goes the same way. You can't
just start a robotics program

1289
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:36,780
and just build robots. It's
complementary to your math

1290
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:39,600
programs and stuff like that in
the classroom. So I think we

1291
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,540
really, really work well. One of
the things we can do at the Rec

1292
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:47,820
Foundation, one of the huge
values that we have is, when I

1293
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:50,250
first started the REC
Foundation, we gave out grants,

1294
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:52,440
but it was always equipment
grant, that was the only grant

1295
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,810
that you got from the REC
Foundation was a robot kit,

1296
01:15:54,810 --> 01:15:57,600
right. But we've listened to the
teaching community, the

1297
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,900
education community, and they
need more than that they need

1298
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:04,560
resources. And the beauty of
this position is we've been able

1299
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,710
to go to the north of Grumman
and the Googles and the Tesla's

1300
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:11,220
and now we're able to get
funding for them for stipends.

1301
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:15,840
And for other resources. So now
we can go back to the teachers

1302
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,640
in the classroom. And we're
going to like, if you're going

1303
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:21,960
to do a robotics team, we can
give you $1,000 or $2,000. And

1304
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,820
we can give you other you know,
continuing tech training and

1305
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:29,880
stuff like that. So we don't
just give kits anymore, we still

1306
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,940
give a lot of robot kits out as
grants, but we give out so much

1307
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:36,030
more. And that's where we
really, really complement each

1308
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:38,700
other. Because let's face it in
the United States, football

1309
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:41,910
coaches, basketball coaches,
they all get paid stipends to be

1310
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:46,500
coaches, why not robotics
coaches, and I think other

1311
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,620
organizations were really
challenging that. And there's

1312
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:54,420
been a huge, huge increase in
our sponsors and government

1313
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:57,270
grants, giving us money that we
can give stipends to robotics

1314
01:16:57,270 --> 01:16:58,020
teachers.

1315
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:01,200
Audrow Nash: That's really
awesome. I like that idea a lot.

1316
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:05,490
It's, I mean, it definitely
makes sense. Like, it's crazy,

1317
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:08,850
if it's basketball coaches, and
football coaches getting

1318
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:12,450
stipends. And then the robotics
team, I mean, especially if

1319
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:15,240
you're bringing in someone who's
having to learn these things,

1320
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:18,480
and be very involved or, like,
it's very nice if they can get a

1321
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:22,620
stipend to to just kind of help
out with it. Because it might be

1322
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:24,030
at the expense of other areas in
their

1323
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:26,550
Dan Mantz: life. Educators
getting rich on their on their

1324
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:29,190
stipend, right. But the thing
is, we don't want them to cost

1325
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:32,490
them money, right. So I'm sure
most of our stipends just cover

1326
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:37,980
the gas and pizza and the spare
parts that they buy. And

1327
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:40,530
nobody's actually increasing
their net worth because of the

1328
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:43,530
stipends. But at least it's not
costing them more money. And

1329
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:46,740
again, it just doesn't as the
United States for us to continue

1330
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:49,260
to evolve. And of course, we're
a global foundation. So all the

1331
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:52,650
worlds but particularly in the
United States, you see a

1332
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:55,950
difference. People ask me
geographically, what's different

1333
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:59,220
about teams in the Northeast or
the south of the Pacific

1334
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:02,100
Northwest? Well, you know,
there's a lot of programs in the

1335
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,830
Northeast that have been paying
their robotics coaches and

1336
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:08,160
teachers for a long time, right.
And they're very, very stable,

1337
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,470
and they have excellent
students. And then you have

1338
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:13,860
emerging areas in the United
States that never thought about

1339
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,320
paying a robotics coach, they
never even thought about having

1340
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:20,070
a robotics team. In Alabama is a
great example. When I joined the

1341
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:23,640
REC Foundation, there was
probably 100 teams in Alabama.

1342
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:28,440
And it's almost at 1000. Now
because our staff really did a

1343
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:31,830
great job of working with
teachers and educators. And then

1344
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:36,300
the detail Alabama Department of
Education started investing

1345
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:40,380
money. The first year was
250,000, this past year 850,000.

1346
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:44,670
and other organizations in
Alabama started, you know,

1347
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:48,840
Hyundai, again, not a sponsor to
the REC foundation directly. But

1348
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:52,710
Hyundai is making sure that
every elementary middle and high

1349
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:56,040
school in Montgomery, Alabama
has a robotics team and you have

1350
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,710
score is making sure these
teachers are getting their

1351
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:01,860
training and the Department of
Education is giving stipends. So

1352
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:05,880
they all build together. And now
Alabama, has got an incredible

1353
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:08,700
robotics program. And guess
what, there's a lot of factories

1354
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:11,220
in Alabama, a lot of automotive
and other factories, and they

1355
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:15,300
need the students. So some
places have been committed to

1356
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:18,660
doing this for a lot longer. You
know, and you know, Michigan is

1357
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:23,220
an example of a state that's had
robotics programs for 25 years,

1358
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:25,440
and you have other parts of the
country that are just starting

1359
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,250
to get into it.

1360
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:30,990
Audrow Nash: What do you So you
mentioned that there were a few

1361
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:33,930
schools that were adding this
into the main curriculum, not

1362
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:36,630
just as an as an
extracurricular. Can you tell me

1363
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:37,410
a bit about that?

1364
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:39,839
Dan Mantz: Yeah, sure that I
would say that pendulum is

1365
01:19:39,839 --> 01:19:43,859
really increasing, you know,
maybe five years ago 10%. And

1366
01:19:43,859 --> 01:19:48,749
that's at least 30%. Now, I'm
not talking condition panels

1367
01:19:48,779 --> 01:19:53,879
you're at if schools or schools
are actually whether they call

1368
01:19:53,879 --> 01:19:58,319
it in manufacturing, or whether
they call it engineering, or

1369
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:01,379
technology. I mean, I've heard
all All right, so uh, technology

1370
01:20:01,379 --> 01:20:04,289
clicking, but I was at a
competition this past weekend,

1371
01:20:04,589 --> 01:20:09,509
and the top teams there. If they
start as freshmen, they can take

1372
01:20:09,509 --> 01:20:12,839
technology. And then they take
technology to then engineering

1373
01:20:12,839 --> 01:20:16,739
one, and engineering two. And
they meet every single day just

1374
01:20:16,739 --> 01:20:20,039
like you do for History or
English or whatever. But they

1375
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:25,079
have their technology class, and
they use Vex and, and they start

1376
01:20:25,079 --> 01:20:27,929
by building simple mechanisms.
And then they learn about

1377
01:20:27,929 --> 01:20:30,719
motors. And then next thing you
know, you're a sophomore, and

1378
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:33,839
you're building more complex
stuff, because they do it every

1379
01:20:33,839 --> 01:20:37,649
single day for an hour a day. By
the time they're senior, these

1380
01:20:37,649 --> 01:20:40,979
kids are really, really good.
And most of them are actually

1381
01:20:40,979 --> 01:20:43,919
going and getting engineering
degrees. But I have one student

1382
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:46,979
that has a job at John Deere
lined up, he's going right to

1383
01:20:46,979 --> 01:20:49,559
John Deere out of high school,
right? He's going to get his

1384
01:20:49,589 --> 01:20:53,819
industry certification and go
and Tesla has similar programs,

1385
01:20:53,819 --> 01:20:57,209
right? Where some of these
students, why go into debt,

1386
01:20:57,209 --> 01:21:01,589
right? Why go work for Tesla and
John Deere and no pay for you to

1387
01:21:01,589 --> 01:21:04,379
take classes at your community
college or your four year

1388
01:21:04,589 --> 01:21:08,279
university. So they're paying
for you. They're paying you a

1389
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:11,369
salary to do the job, and
they're paying you to get your

1390
01:21:11,369 --> 01:21:14,759
certifications and your degree.
And next thing you know, you

1391
01:21:14,759 --> 01:21:17,999
have a two or four year degree
but back to your original

1392
01:21:17,999 --> 01:21:23,279
question. Schools themselves
know that we need to do a better

1393
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:25,499
job for the students and make
sure they're prepared for the

1394
01:21:25,499 --> 01:21:28,439
workforce. So more and more
students, more and more schools

1395
01:21:28,649 --> 01:21:32,009
are investing in technology.
It's kind of full circle. You

1396
01:21:32,009 --> 01:21:35,399
know, when I was in high school,
we had vocational programs, the

1397
01:21:35,399 --> 01:21:39,509
HVAC, the machine shop, etc. And
then we got away and then we

1398
01:21:39,509 --> 01:21:42,329
said everybody needs to go to
college. And now we're kind of

1399
01:21:42,329 --> 01:21:45,389
going back and saying, Man, all
these people that repaired our

1400
01:21:45,389 --> 01:21:48,239
air conditioners, or did diesel
mechanics, they're all getting

1401
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:51,749
ready to retire. We have nobody
coming behind them. So these

1402
01:21:51,749 --> 01:21:54,119
schools, the government's
they're reinvesting in these

1403
01:21:54,119 --> 01:21:57,809
programs. But now it's not just
HVAC and diesel mechanics. Now

1404
01:21:57,809 --> 01:22:02,399
it's robot technician, etcetera.
Hmm, that's really what we at

1405
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:05,219
the RSC Foundation, we just work
really, really closely with

1406
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:09,299
these educators so that they
have the tools so that they can

1407
01:22:09,329 --> 01:22:11,579
bring these programs to their
classes.

1408
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:16,230
Audrow Nash: What do you think
the so you think the future of

1409
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:19,740
education is, or a future of
universities will be that fewer

1410
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:24,720
people go to actually get like a
Bachelors of Science and

1411
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:29,130
something and maybe more people,
it'll it would be more like,

1412
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:33,600
say, somewhere is some places in
Europe that have more vocational

1413
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,990
schools and this kind of thing,
you think that education will

1414
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:38,700
start to lean that way? Yeah, I

1415
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,410
Dan Mantz: think I think the
data is trending that way, I'm

1416
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:42,690
going to be really careful here,
because we have a lot of

1417
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,990
university partners, right. A
lot of great universities we

1418
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:49,860
partner with, but I think we're
already seeing declining

1419
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:52,380
enrollment in so many schools.
And it's not a secret that they

1420
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:55,830
expect a lot of colleges and
universities to fail in the

1421
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:59,670
future. Because it's just gotten
so expensive, you know, for

1422
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:02,460
students to go. So I do think
you're going to see these

1423
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:06,900
alternative career paths instead
of, again, the internship, the

1424
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:10,860
externship program that Tesla
did is a great model where the

1425
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:13,470
graduates start, you start the
program, when you're in high

1426
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:17,160
school, and you get experience
working on the factory floor,

1427
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:22,110
you're working in the shops, you
get paid. And then again, if you

1428
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:24,840
want to go get an interesting
certification, they pay for

1429
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,960
that, then you start taking
classes at a two year school, I

1430
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:31,470
think you're going to see more
and more organizations do that.

1431
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:35,400
And I think you're just going to
see people make financial

1432
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,740
decisions that make sense. And I
think you're gonna there is

1433
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:40,620
going to be some type of
consolidation. And I think our

1434
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:44,370
universities will step up, and I
think our community colleges are

1435
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:47,220
fantastic in this country. It's
really one of those gems that we

1436
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:50,070
have, that the rest of the world
doesn't, you know, because maybe

1437
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:52,320
we don't have tech programs in
high school like they do in

1438
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:56,430
Europe. But we do have these
community colleges, and we have

1439
01:23:56,430 --> 01:24:00,030
a lot of programs, you know,
that are supported in community

1440
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:03,840
colleges. And that's a good way
for students to get the skill

1441
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:04,290
set.

1442
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:08,490
Audrow Nash: Interesting. I know
very little about the community

1443
01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:11,850
colleges and what kind of things
they offer. But it you're saying

1444
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:15,450
it helps people get vocational
skills or Yeah,

1445
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:18,390
Dan Mantz: I mean, you get you
get your you know, and some pass

1446
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:22,950
you get your baseline to go to a
four year university gets your

1447
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:26,040
your general classes out of the
way you get your, your math,

1448
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:29,730
your sciences, your history, and
like in Texas, if you go to what

1449
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:33,030
a accredited community college
in Texas, the four year

1450
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:35,340
universities have to take those
credits, right. And there's a

1451
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:39,030
lot of states that have similar
programs. But so many community

1452
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:44,970
colleges that we work with now
have industrial automation are

1453
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,850
our technology programs where
they're literally teaching the

1454
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:52,800
skills and after two years, the
students earn certifications and

1455
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,310
then they go get the jobs.
Right. So community colleges are

1456
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:59,070
really the government you know,
Department of Defense is

1457
01:24:59,070 --> 01:25:01,950
investing in community ecologist
because they know that's a

1458
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:04,470
really good way for us to train
our workforce.

1459
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:09,000
Audrow Nash: Interesting. Yeah,
it makes complete sense. What do

1460
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:15,390
you so we're beginning to wrap
up? What do you think, for kind

1461
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:20,040
of the future of education and
programs like wreck? Do you

1462
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:25,200
think it'll be enough? For all
of the help? Like, will we be

1463
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:29,700
able to provide a good number of
workers for the shortages? Or

1464
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:32,250
just how do you think of things
going forward?

1465
01:25:32,819 --> 01:25:34,949
Dan Mantz: Well, we're gonna
make a debt, if nothing else,

1466
01:25:34,949 --> 01:25:38,519
right, we're gonna make, we're
gonna help and the REC

1467
01:25:38,519 --> 01:25:41,939
foundation, you know, we have a
lot of great programs, there's

1468
01:25:41,939 --> 01:25:45,029
other great not for profits out
there, too. And you have, like,

1469
01:25:45,029 --> 01:25:48,479
you know, Apple is investing in
their own education programs.

1470
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:50,339
And there's other companies that
do it. So I think if

1471
01:25:50,369 --> 01:25:53,939
collectively, we all work
together, we are going to

1472
01:25:53,939 --> 01:25:56,759
address the issue, but it's
gonna take some time, it's gonna

1473
01:25:56,759 --> 01:26:02,309
take some time to, to retrain
our teachers, you know, so that

1474
01:26:02,309 --> 01:26:05,699
they have the skill sets to
teach this, it's going to take

1475
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:11,099
time for our industries to adapt
to a different type of model,

1476
01:26:11,099 --> 01:26:15,599
how they, how they employ their
employees. Now, I don't want to

1477
01:26:15,599 --> 01:26:18,179
get too philosophical here, but
you know, students in this

1478
01:26:18,179 --> 01:26:22,019
country, know prefer playing
sports and prefer doing video

1479
01:26:22,019 --> 01:26:25,049
games and stuff like that, you
know, and, and I've traveled,

1480
01:26:25,049 --> 01:26:27,029
I've been fortunate, I've
traveled across the world, and

1481
01:26:27,029 --> 01:26:30,449
then over 50 countries, and
there's other cultures where

1482
01:26:30,449 --> 01:26:34,949
they emphasize academics, and
especially tech, and we're not

1483
01:26:34,949 --> 01:26:37,379
there in this country yet. So
it's going to be an entire

1484
01:26:37,619 --> 01:26:42,179
cultural shift between education
between the government, between

1485
01:26:42,179 --> 01:26:44,909
private companies, public
companies, and not for profits,

1486
01:26:44,909 --> 01:26:47,759
we're all going to have to work
together. And there's great,

1487
01:26:48,419 --> 01:26:50,669
great organizations out there,
like, you know, the REC

1488
01:26:50,669 --> 01:26:54,089
foundation belongs to arm out of
Pittsburgh, advanced robotics

1489
01:26:54,089 --> 01:26:58,289
and manufacturing. And they do a
great job of bringing government

1490
01:26:58,289 --> 01:27:01,559
private industry for year to
year and not for profits

1491
01:27:01,559 --> 01:27:03,089
together to tackle this problem.

1492
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:08,220
Audrow Nash: Awesome. What do
you have anything to share for

1493
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:12,150
people that are interested in
either getting involved as like

1494
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:15,990
students or interested in
getting involved, as someone who

1495
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:19,950
facilitates it or just learning
more? Any resources?

1496
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:22,830
Dan Mantz: I mean, the best, the
easiest thing to do is I always

1497
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:27,270
ask people go to our website,
it's robotics, education.org,

1498
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:31,290
again, robotics education.org.
And on the landing page, it's

1499
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:33,930
like, Are you new to robotics,
and they need you just navigate

1500
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:36,630
the website, you know, VEX
robotics, they also have a

1501
01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:39,000
great, great website for
educators. I mean, they just

1502
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,500
have so many amazing resources
that are free. So go to VEX

1503
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,920
robotics, or go to robotics,
education.org. Those are always

1504
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:50,520
good things. You can always
Google, you know, how do I how

1505
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:54,570
do I start a robotics team, and
our website has those responses.

1506
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:58,290
And that's the best way to do
it. On our website, we have a

1507
01:27:58,290 --> 01:28:01,860
map of the world. And literally,
when you click the country, it

1508
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:06,030
tells you who the REC foundation
person for that country is or if

1509
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:09,060
you click the state that tells
you who the event site is and

1510
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:13,350
who the team site is. And then
we have things like online

1511
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:16,710
challenges, too. So maybe this
year one, you don't want to jump

1512
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:19,770
into starting a robotics team.
But you can do online

1513
01:28:19,770 --> 01:28:23,910
challenges. And some of them are
like CAD based, some of them are

1514
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:27,840
about diversity and inclusion
programs like girl powered, but

1515
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,930
there's different ways to do it
there. And then there's also

1516
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:35,160
grants, you know, we know that
cost is a barrier of entry. So

1517
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:38,070
we have an entire page on
grants. And then for the

1518
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:40,800
students out there, you know,
the Ric foundation gets close to

1519
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,980
60 million. Well, we don't give
it directly, but our university

1520
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:48,390
partners give $60 million in
scholarships for students. So

1521
01:28:48,570 --> 01:28:52,050
all those resources available by
the website. So if you're an

1522
01:28:52,050 --> 01:28:55,410
educator, come to our site or go
to the web site, if you're

1523
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:59,730
really wanting to learn about
starting a team and how we can

1524
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:01,680
help you in the classroom, go to
our website.

1525
01:29:03,149 --> 01:29:04,919
Audrow Nash: Awesome. Alright,
it's been a pleasure speaking

1526
01:29:04,919 --> 01:29:05,249
with you.

1527
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:09,600
Dan Mantz: I've enjoyed it so
much. And, again, if anybody

1528
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:14,490
here wants to reach out to me
directly, my email was, Dan

1529
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:20,070
underscore man's robotics.
education.com. And I take I

1530
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:22,530
always respond, sometimes they
don't get to it in the first day

1531
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:26,640
or even the first couple of
days. But I'm always, always,

1532
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,380
always happy to reach out. I'll
see if I can share this on the

1533
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:36,270
camera real quick. I give this
back and it's backwards, but

1534
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:39,360
it's robotics education.org I
just realized I said calm. So

1535
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:44,010
Dan, underscore man's at
robotics. education.org. And me

1536
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:46,800
or someone from my team will be
happy to help you navigate,

1537
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:50,520
which I can at times can be
terrifying. But I guarantee you

1538
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,340
it's rewarding. If you talk to
the people that are involved in

1539
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:56,070
our program, they'll tell you,
we're really making a difference

1540
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:57,480
and it's really rewarding for
them.

1541
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:02,580
Audrow Nash: Awesome. Thank you,
Dan. And everyone thank you for

1542
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:07,680
having me thanks for listening
to this conversation with Dan

1543
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:11,250
Mance thank you again to our
founding sponsor open robotics

1544
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,330
See you next time
