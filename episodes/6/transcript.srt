1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,250
Audrow Nash: This is a
conversation with Tobias Holmes.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,790
Tobias is a Quality Assurance
Manager at Blue River

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,360
technology, which uses computer
vision and robotics and

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,710
agriculture. Blue River was
acquired in 2017. By John Deere,

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,120
we begin this interview with an
introduction to agriculture and

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,780
the problem that Blue River is
working to solve. This includes

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,030
talking about row and non row
crops, and herbicide resistance,

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,900
both of which I knew very little
about before this conversation.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,560
After establishing the problem,
we talked about how blue river

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,190
systems work, quality assurance
and testing and hardware,

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,150
machine learning and weed
spraying the acquisition of Blue

12
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,040
River by John Deere, the future
of robotics, in agriculture, and

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,140
on education. This is the Sense
Think Act Podcast. Thank you to

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,650
our founding sponsor, Open
Robotics. And now here's my

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,540
conversation with Tobias Holmes.

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,810
Would you introduce yourself,
Tobias?

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,950
Tobias Holmes: Hi, I'm Tobias
Holmes. I am currently the

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,690
manager of quality at Blue River
technology here and in

19
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,410
Sunnyvale, California, a
subsidiary of John Deere

20
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,970
Corporation. And, and yeah, I've
been working in robotics for

21
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,640
about seven years now.

22
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,780
Audrow Nash: Would you tell me a
bit about Blue River?

23
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,370
Tobias Holmes: So Blue River,
the company started out what

24
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:41,940
what our co founders, Jorge
Harada, and Lee reading. A

25
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,540
couple guys from Stanford,
decided that they wanted to

26
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,510
bring high tech, you know, high
tech tech high technology into

27
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:56,430
the agricultural space. So years
ago, probably about 10 years

28
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,560
ago, they started out going
carried harvesting. And you take

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,920
what's out there harvesting,
Carry, carry weeding, sorry,

30
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:11,040
carrier weeding, and in 30 days,
yeah, so basically being able to

31
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,800
look at a carrots and be able to
clean up the weeds that are

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,770
around the character that the
character actually gives you

33
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,610
more read more of the harvest,
you get more of a yield from the

34
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,940
harvest. And and that was
something that that was

35
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,460
interesting, there was a problem
that was happening in the world,

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,510
they were in the tackling that
using various robotics

37
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,480
technologies, and talk to a girl
who was like, Hey, you guys have

38
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,170
a nice technology here. But what
I really needed to be utilized

39
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,160
is in leading of row crops, and
so Blue River transition from

40
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,660
Audrow Nash: What are row crops?
I don't know that much about

41
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,490
agriculture. And I don't know
about how carrots maybe are not

42
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,290
row crops. What's a row crop?

43
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,680
Tobias Holmes: So row crops are
when you typically think about a

44
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,080
farm and when you're on a farm
where a grower grows, they grow

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,460
their crops into these like, you
know, very uniform rows across

46
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,190
their entire field. And that
this allows them to get the

47
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,170
maximum amount of yield from a
particular crop you're trying to

48
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,630
grow, it maximizes the space
that you have, in order to to

49
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,860
get the most out of it.

50
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,500
Audrow Nash: So you just plant
them, like optimally spaced in

51
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,560
lines. And why why are carrots
not row crops? I would just

52
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,330
assume everything is planted in
a row.

53
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,350
Tobias Holmes: So carrots
typically are, you know, they

54
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,520
kind of they're kind of
scattered around. And, and you

55
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,260
just kind of like throw the
seeds as you go out and implant

56
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,490
them. Wherever they're last row
crops, we actually like very

57
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,470
used machines that are very, you
know, particular about where

58
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,940
they grow, where they are,
there's less, there's less

59
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,310
ambiguity, and the in what our
place, they're very, very

60
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,120
structured and very, very light,
you know, every 10 inches, you

61
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,460
know, just depending on
particular crop, they're very,

62
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,510
they're 10 inches of space from
each other 30 inches, you know,

63
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,970
from the next row, it's very,
very prescribed, whereas non

64
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,840
real crops are, you know, they
kind of they kind of are planted

65
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,400
in a row, if you will, but but
but what, what, what typically

66
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,990
happens is you plant a couple in
a row, and whichever one is the

67
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,460
best, the best vibrant one after
a little bit of time, you kill

68
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,970
the other ones, and then you
keep the you keep the one that

69
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,980
you want. And so river did that
kind of work in agriculture in

70
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,550
California. You can imagine
there's lots of vegetables,

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,910
fruits that are grown here and
they've grown in that manner.

72
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,900
You planted a couple of them, as
you go down and the ones that's

73
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,260
the most viable, that's the one
you keep, you kill the rest.

74
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,710
Audrow Nash: Okay, and you kill
the rest so that the one that

75
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,720
looks most viable, or best at
that time, has more resources

76
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,860
available to it less to compete
with in that spectrum is a

77
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,030
better harvest. Maybe.

78
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,340
Tobias Holmes: That's right,
it's so better quality

79
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,160
ones.That's, that's right. You
know, you want to give that, you

80
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,850
know, every, every person wants
to bigger to see or strawberry,

81
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,750
bigger, juicy carrot, whatever
that is. And so, so and so that

82
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,370
allows you to say, okay, hey, I
planted these in a nice bed of a

83
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:45,180
fertilized ground. And whichever
ground is a is is a, you know,

84
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,690
whichever one out of the of the
three or four, that is more

85
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,080
viable. That's the one that I
keep, and then I kill the rest.

86
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:57,720
That's right. So as you get more
and more, you get more yield is

87
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,410
what we typically call it, a
grower typically, is concerned

88
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,940
about the yield of the crop that
they they are planning, and they

89
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,730
want the most yield for for the
amount of planning.

90
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,250
Audrow Nash: So they have a
certain amount of space, and

91
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,790
they basically want to get as
much product, carrots or

92
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,060
whatever it might be, as
possible for that amount of

93
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,540
land.

94
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,770
Tobias Holmes: That's absolutely
right.

95
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:26,880
Audrow Nash: Okay, so with row
row plants, row crops and non

96
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,710
row crops like carrots, does the
machinery change for because I'm

97
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,220
imagining like a big tractor
driving down tracks? And so I'm

98
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,860
thinking for the non row crops,
which you said are kind of in

99
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:44,370
rows anyways, does is it like
squishing a bunch of them? Is

100
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,310
the row was I would imagine it's
going kind of in the seams

101
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,930
between the rows of plants.

102
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,350
Tobias Holmes: And so yeah, so
you can imagine it, there's like

103
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,790
these little mounds of dirt you
create, and even something

104
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,150
depending on where you are in
the country on the world. That

105
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,540
can be different, but But
essentially, you're maximizing

106
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,200
the land space, and you're
maximizing the ability of that

107
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,700
particular seed to to be the
best year. And so the

108
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,200
transition. And so the
transition is, is you don't you

109
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,220
don't carve out so much land,
because you don't know, when you

110
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,210
know, particular crops like that
are fruits and vegetables, you

111
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,200
don't know which one will be the
one that actually takes hold and

112
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,000
is the champion, if you will,
that part of the land to give

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,240
you put three or four of them
down to see which one is really

114
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,840
taking the resources out of the
ground. Yep, in a row crop, you

115
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,350
know that, hey, if I plant the
seed here, this probably gonna

116
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,940
grow if I plan in perfect
places, you know, soy bean, and

117
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,520
the particular row crops that
we're talking about soy bean,

118
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,540
cotton corn, if you plant them
there, they're probably going to

119
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,580
be just fine. The thing that
will be the resource, so the

120
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:05,100
resource wouldn't be the
resource like pool wouldn't be

121
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:12,660
weeds, it would be the... Excuse
me, I said that wrong. And a

122
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,660
vegetable crop, you want to
plant multiples, because you

123
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,020
don't know what the crop itself
will take? Yeah in the row crop,

124
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,090
you know, the crop itself will
take but then there's

125
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:25,320
competition as weeds. And so now
you have to kill the weeds and

126
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,550
vegetables and fruits, you need
to plant multiples, because that

127
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,750
that we'll see may just not grow
right on its own. So you can't

128
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,270
just plant one and I know that
that one's gonna, but you got to

129
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,420
plant multiples. Because you
know, out of the if I plant at

130
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,110
least four, one or two of those
guys are going to grow. Yeah,

131
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,450
and then you and then you take
the best out of the out of the

132
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,560
group was in row crops, I plant
a seed that seed is going to

133
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,180
grow the only competition is
weeds. Yeah. And, and so and so

134
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,000
in that situation, you know,
you're planning, you're planting

135
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,380
seeds that are going to grow,
you just now need to make sure

136
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,670
that you you provided the best
environment in order for it to

137
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,030
grow.

138
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,400
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So if I
understand correctly, when you

139
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,970
have the non row crops, you just
have like a hump of soil that

140
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,210
goes back in a row effectively
denotes a non row crop and you

141
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,630
just like throw seeds all over
it. Right plants will come up

142
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:25,290
anywhere in that big wide row
and kill the ones that look less

143
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,520
promising to save the ones that
are more promising. Okay. And in

144
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,630
the row ones, you just have a
narrow row where the seat seat

145
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,490
seats easy. And they Oh, yes.
Right. And so in the non row

146
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,480
ones you are killing the
competing ones of the same

147
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,110
species that are less viable.
And row row ones you're more

148
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,540
concerned about killing the
weeds that are competing with

149
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,000
the crop you're interested in.
Is that correct?

150
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,230
Tobias Holmes: Absolutely.

151
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,220
Audrow Nash: Okay, so with going
back a little bit, so with Blue

152
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,720
River they were starting with
these non row crops. And then

153
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,160
feedback from customers was we
are interested in row crops.

154
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,030
Continuing from there, what
happened?

155
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,620
Tobias Holmes: So Blue River had
to make a shift right that the,

156
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,690
the technology, the actual even
even the agro agronomical When I

157
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,620
say agronomical, I'm talking
about the Cool World, the word

158
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:27,750
the the way that you know, you
do something in agriculture,

159
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,390
Audrow Nash: Is it like
economical but for agriculture?

160
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,800
Tobias Holmes: agriculture, so
So in this case, we have all the

161
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,260
seeds that are out there, and we
want to get rid of the ones that

162
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,650
are not viable. So how did you
do that, in a way an

163
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,370
agricultural? And so and there's
multiple ways you can play, you

164
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,840
can spray herbicide, you can go
in and dig up the ones that you

165
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,590
didn't want, you know, or you
can you can you can even apply

166
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:56,040
her fertilizer, and that's what
Blue River did they apply

167
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,000
fertilizer. And what happens if
you apply too much fertilizer to

168
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,930
a plant? It'll explode it, you
know, it'll just grow so fast

169
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:09,300
that it can't exploded. Realize
think about that is not that

170
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,680
that fertilizer is in that soil.
The other plants that makes the

171
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,510
one that is viable, ie that one,
how can can grow stronger,

172
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,320
because now you have made a very
fertile environment. The ones

173
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,070
that were weak exploded, but
this guy that is not weak, took

174
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,890
that took that fertilization and
use it and grew better.

175
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,130
Audrow Nash: So again, not
knowing much about agriculture,

176
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,510
why does it... so it explodes,
it grows too fast, and then it

177
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,500
can't support that or something?
Why? Why? Why does it die?

178
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,910
Because it grows too fast?

179
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,780
Unknown: Because it's just it's
just the fertilizers a kind of

180
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,270
Yeah, how to put that it is
something that encourages the

181
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:55,770
plant to grow very fast, but
good plant has to be able to

182
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,400
handle it

183
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,930
Audrow Nash: Does it grow to...
is it like a startup in some

184
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,010
sense, that takes venture
capital funding, and it

185
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,980
basically gets a huge
investment, but if the money, so

186
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,270
you grow rapidly, and then
expenses are coming, so then

187
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:13,890
the...

188
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,130
Unknown: Essentially, you're
going too fast. And I would put

189
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,840
a similar startup somewhere
going too fast if you don't have

190
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,010
the funding, but the but you
don't have the infrastructure if

191
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,080
you don't have the
infrastructure to handle it.

192
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,460
Right. So that viable crop,
right, that one that is like

193
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:41,070
it's gonna it's gonna sustain,
that one has already has gained

194
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,150
all the things necessary to reap
the benefit of that fertilizer.

195
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,330
These other ones are set in such
a non capable state, that when

196
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,570
you you feed them fertilizer,
they, they grow so fast, but

197
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,390
they're not capable, they're not
ready for it. In other words,

198
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,070
Audrow Nash: So they grow before
they're ready, and they

199
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,120
overextend themselves.

200
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,830
Unknown: There you go, it's too
much, this is too much ploom.

201
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,910
And a guy,

202
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,840
Audrow Nash: I'm thinking of
like Napolean now and having too

203
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,730
big of an empire, and then it
collapses.

204
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,360
Unknown: It collapse. And you
could think about it as you

205
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,510
could think about it, as I have
too much resources that I cannot

206
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:24,630
contain it, I cannot help hold
it within my infrastructure. So

207
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:30,210
I need to so I so what happens
is it just explodes. Whereas the

208
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:34,050
plants that are the plants that
can handle that they take it in

209
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,740
and they use it and grow, which
is what to expect when you get

210
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,480
you know, like, like an
investment or an increase. And

211
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,200
it is a ridiculous amount.
Right? It is a it would be like,

212
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,690
you know, you give somebody
who's never had a business

213
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,560
before in their life, you know,
30 million, right? Like, they

214
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,630
don't they wouldn't know what to
do with that property. Right?

215
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:55,650
Yep.

216
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,680
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. It's like
getting rich, quick kind of

217
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,480
thing. And then it just goes
away. Okay.

218
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,600
Unknown: They have no ability to
deal with it. Right and no

219
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,540
ability to deal with it. Yeah.
And the thing about that is that

220
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,570
that money doesn't go anywhere.
That money is still out in the

221
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,990
environment in the system. Yeah.
And that and and that next crop

222
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,170
that's next to those to those in
those plants that get killed

223
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,980
that way, reaps the benefit of
it. So you're fertilizing. So

224
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:24,000
it's kind of a two pronged
process. You're gonna fertilize

225
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,940
your soil anyway, because you
want your plants to grow. But

226
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,660
the ones that are not viable,
you fertilize it to the point

227
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,770
where they're going to die, but
that overlying fertilizer still

228
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,190
stays in the ground and allows
the ones that are not going to

229
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:44,640
die, to grow, to flourish to be
better. You harvest those, that

230
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,280
ground is still very fertile
with all those resources that

231
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,820
you come in are still there. You
can go plant again next season,

232
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,540
the grounds fertile, it grows
again. You do this process

233
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,950
again. So you're, you're kinda
you know, it's kind of a cycle.

234
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,990
fertilizing the ground but also
getting rid of the the the weeds

235
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,680
to the crops that are not going
to they're not going to make it

236
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,910
right if you give those guys an
extra shot, so that they so that

237
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,070
they they're not going to make
it and then...

238
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:19,530
Audrow Nash: Is this row crops
where it's weeds that are

239
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,080
competing, or we speaking about
non row crops, or both?

240
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,510
Tobias Holmes: That was non row
crops. So in row in a row crop,

241
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,790
it's a different environment and
that's what I was talking about

242
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:32,190
agronomical tools, right. And so
in a row crop. You know,

243
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,760
fertilizing the weeds is not the
way to go, right? You don't want

244
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,330
the weeds to grow. You want to
deplete the weeds, you want to

245
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,470
show that was removed?

246
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,590
Audrow Nash: I see. So that was
with the non row crop, what

247
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,160
we're talking about with over
fertilizing them. So you do it

248
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:54,750
to the non row crop that are not
promising. And thus, they grow

249
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,170
too fast, then they explode and
die. Not literally explode,

250
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,380
probably. But for the row crop,
you're saying now we have a

251
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,190
different strategy?

252
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,950
Tobias Holmes: That's right. And
that's what I'm talking about

253
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,800
the agronomic the strategy,
right is that so and so in

254
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,510
agriculture, in plants, you can
imagine there's this a variety

255
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:16,950
of plants and in the agronomic,
the agricultural world is just

256
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,760
as varied as humans, right,
there's just life itself is just

257
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,930
so varied. And it's even more so
in the plant world. And so

258
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,770
different strategies are needed
for different types of plants

259
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,460
that you're going. And in a row
crop situation where you know,

260
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,160
the seed is going to take, you
know that when you plant that

261
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,890
seed, it's going to come up and
it's going to come out of the

262
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,500
ground, it's just a matter of
how much yield you're going to

263
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,130
get from it. Your strategy there
is different because now you're

264
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:48,840
not competing with others, like
seeds, you're completing what

265
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,220
you're competing with, what we
are completely different plants

266
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,040
that are trying to suck the
resources away from the plant,

267
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,440
you're trying to, you know, the
cash crop is what we call it.

268
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,720
And, and so in that situation,
you actually want to kill, you

269
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,560
want to alleviate that leak, you
want to alleviate those plants,

270
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,280
Audrow Nash: Alleviate is a
funny word for that. It's the

271
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:16,170
problem, you're alleviating the
problem, and thus you're killing

272
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,220
the plant. I see.

273
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,820
Unknown: It's killing the plant,
it's killing the plant. It's

274
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,220
making sure that that plant
because you never really kill

275
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,370
it. You never really kill it,
right? Like like those, those,

276
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,090
Audrow Nash: But you remove it
as a competitor for resources.

277
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,930
Unknown: So you think about
plants, you think about life,

278
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,400
life always wants to persist, it
doesn't really die, right? It's

279
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,850
hardy. That's absolutely true.

280
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,890
Audrow Nash: Only the cash crops
die occasionally.

281
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,930
We purposely we purposely
harvest those, right, but the

282
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,350
weeds are just there. And the
interesting thing that happened,

283
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,630
so just go back, you know, 30
years, they had what roundup

284
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,750
they had they had, you know
chemicals that could that would

285
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,780
you know they have their crops
genetically modified, you can

286
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,350
spray the entire field, we call
that broadcasting. So you spray

287
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,430
the entire field with herbicide,
the plants that you were trying

288
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,100
to keep were genetically
modified so that that herbicide

289
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,690
did not kill that plant. But it
killed everything that wasn't

290
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,810
anything like that all the weeds
that were in that plant that had

291
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,560
a modification in it to that
herbicide. And so all those

292
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,470
plants and what you would see if
you could go down a growth field

293
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,730
and would be what we call clean,
you would only see the crop that

294
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,630
the girl was trying to grow,
meaning there was nothing else

295
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:47,460
but everything else was dirt in
the field or soil. Only the crop

296
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,210
was there. And that now was the
American agriculture for 3040

297
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,470
years, you know, using these
genetically modified plants.

298
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,130
Okay, what happened was is over
time he is talking about life

299
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:04,260
and how hard it is you kill the
just dude, you killed all the

300
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,440
weeds that were susceptible to
that herbicide. And the only

301
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,900
ones that are persistent were
ones that were able to fight

302
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,170
through the herbicide. And so
now they became they build up

303
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:17,880
the herbicide resistance.
Valerie's so now they are the

304
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,880
old herbicide resistant plants
are the only ones that are

305
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,870
reproducing. So now when you
reproduce you're only be

306
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,260
producing herbicide resistant
plants and that is causing a

307
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,670
huge air a huge battle man
gotcha because now you now the

308
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:37,500
plants are being able to build
up resistance faster than the

309
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,830
engineers can build up new
technologies to actually kill

310
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,400
those those resistant plants.
And so now now you're not you're

311
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,120
having, you know, what we call
unclean fields, fields where

312
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,720
growers are spraying. They're
planting crops and these

313
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,080
herbicides are resisting it. And
so now they have to come up with

314
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,200
something different different
chemicals different ability to

315
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,830
get rid of the plants.

316
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,230
And that's in the timeline of
like the 30 years you said...

317
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,090
Unknown: So 30 years, 30 years
we've been using the Roundup

318
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,300
herbicide, we've been using
herbicide, or I would say the

319
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,790
last 10 years is where they
really become maybe in the last

320
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:19,020
five years is where they really
become prevalent herbicide

321
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,530
resistant weeds, to the point
where they're, they're, they're

322
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,980
starting to, like, you know,
hey, the strategies that growers

323
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,370
use, and there's multiples, as
herbicide, there's a there's a

324
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,540
will be called a field fighting
you call when you kind of just

325
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:38,400
trim up the dirt in the row to
kill some of the weeds. There's

326
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,110
multiple techniques, but but
like I said, you know, alleviate

327
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,770
the problem, you want to give
the crop that you're trying to

328
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,640
grow and get killed from the one
that you're trying to sell the

329
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,810
best opportunity to win in the,
you know, in the competing of

330
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,780
resources that are in the
ground. So you want that crop to

331
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,990
get as much of the resources as
you can, and to provide, you

332
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,750
know, the weeds and other
things, less resources so that

333
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,650
they die off?

334
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,770
Audrow Nash: This may be a silly
question, but why not just make

335
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:14,160
an incredibly resource dense
field and have a bunch of weeds

336
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,690
but also have your cash crop?

337
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,490
Unknown: Because the weeds the
weeds are. The weeds are.

338
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,120
They're called weeds, right?
They're just plants. Yeah, but

339
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,930
we call them we undesirable not
cash plants. And the reason why

340
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:33,030
is because they they're very
effective and sucking the

341
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:37,770
resource in that you won't your
cash crop will not crop, they

342
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,130
will take over.

343
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,590
Audrow Nash: Starving it of
resources and they grow way

344
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,100
quicker.

345
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,300
Tobias Holmes: Their genetics
are so that they will take over.

346
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,380
And those viable those viable
crops that you really want that

347
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,620
you want to keep, you know,
which was you know, when you

348
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,650
think about, you just think
about society, and you think

349
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,880
about, you know, just biology
again, in the world, you know,

350
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,880
things that are valuable to
humans, particularly the humans

351
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,720
are things that are scarce. So
things like you know, cotton

352
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,990
soybeans, plants that you could
eat plants that you could, you

353
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,280
could read, you know, something
that was due Sunday, they

354
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,530
weren't just plentiful
everywhere, and everybody could

355
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,050
just have it and it was great.
In order to make that,

356
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,840
especially for the population of
the world today, you have to

357
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,220
very strategically go and grow
it. Right. That's kind of how

358
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:30,090
the world got as populated as it
as it has, is because we no

359
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,600
longer just kind of go hunt and
gather and just go find where

360
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,810
they're where the right stuff is
off the tree as it grew

361
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,570
naturally. Because in order for
it to grow naturally, you would

362
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:43,260
have to get in an environment
naturally, that just didn't have

363
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,830
enough competition with all the
other farmers in the area, so

364
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,710
that that thing could grow.
We're very specifically saying,

365
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,830
Hey, we like apples, we like
strawberries, we like

366
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,010
Audrow Nash: soy, whatever else.
Yeah.

367
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,560
Tobias Holmes: So we have to
definitely beat off the fauna

368
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,340
that would that naturally just
grows, that naturally will just

369
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,900
take over. It is and isn't, you
know, necessarily beneficial to

370
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,920
us. It's right, it's plant life,
but we're trying to specifically

371
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,160
grow plant life that's
beneficial to us. And all the

372
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,490
other plant life around is like,
hey, I want to use this. I want

373
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,840
to take this spot up. Yeah,
you're and they don't use much

374
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,600
energy, right, that the reason
why those things are valuable is

375
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,870
because fruits and things like
that need a lot of energy from

376
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,070
the ground. And so, so it's easy
for these other things that

377
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:36,360
don't bear fruit that don't give
us any benefit to grow and

378
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,270
rapidly take over the land
because they don't, they don't

379
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,000
need a lot of energy because
they don't provide anything of

380
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,910
value to us. Fruits and you
know...

381
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,040
Audrow Nash: Stuff that we can
harvest from them.

382
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,860
Unknown: You can think of the
things that that humans care

383
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:55,320
about us the fruit, right. And,
and those things. Take energy.

384
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,480
The things that we don't provide
fruit, necessarily don't don't

385
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,550
take a lot of energy. And they
they're prevalent. They're

386
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,570
everywhere. Yeah.

387
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,880
Audrow Nash: And by fruit you
mean anything we can harvest.

388
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,240
Right? So like, I don't know,
cotton? Like the seed probably

389
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,720
is not a fruit. But you mean
that as in something we can

390
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,400
harvest and then use? Is it
correct?

391
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,380
Unknown: Yeah, absolutely. So
the bulk..

392
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,960
Audrow Nash: The fruit of the
labor.

393
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,190
Tobias Holmes: There you go.

394
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,870
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Gotcha.
Okay. And then so what was the

395
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,430
strategy for row crops?

396
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:32,010
Unknown: So the strategy here
for row crops is to, it's a cool

397
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,380
thing that Blue River did, is
because you're talking about

398
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,230
agriculture, you're talking
about a customer in a market

399
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,050
that's been around since the
beginning of the United States,

400
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,050
right? It's this goes way back.
John Deere has been a company

401
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:47,250
for hundreds of years in the US.
That's awesome. And so the

402
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,730
agriculture is is a mainstay in
the United States. And that

403
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:55,650
customer in that in that market
is not very open to drastic

404
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,410
changes. They've been doing
things the way they've been

405
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,590
doing it for the past 20 years.
You're not just going to come in

406
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,950
here and say, Hey, I got the
spaceship or I got this cool

407
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,310
technology, they're just gonna
make your you know, they're very

408
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,800
adverse to those kinds of things
because they know what they've

409
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,920
been doing. They've been doing
that for for, you know, for a

410
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:20,130
long time. And they're very
adverse to very crazy out of the

411
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:25,440
box changes. And so what we did
was okay, you already use

412
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,920
herbicide, you're already
spraying your entire field,

413
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,310
with, you're broadcasting your
entire field with herbicide to

414
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:36,300
cover every anchor, right. So if
you got 1000 acre field, doing

415
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,970
spraying the entire 1000 acres
with herbicide, even though

416
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,660
there's only beads in certain
pockets of that field, so you

417
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,050
just bring everything but Blue
River did was with the court and

418
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,290
we did have this novel was a you
know, add a camera to that, to

419
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:53,490
that a sprayer, the same spray,
you always been using the same

420
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,670
technology, you used to use any
like pointed out things, we

421
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,760
added a camera, the camera can
look at the ground, it can tell

422
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,180
where the weed exactly located,
and then we spray onto the weed.

423
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,660
Instead of spraying the entire
field, you only spray where the

424
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,230
weed is.

425
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,540
Audrow Nash: With the herbicide?
Is it correct?

426
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,800
Tobias Holmes: That's correct.

427
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:11,970
Audrow Nash: Gotcha.

428
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,370
Tobias Holmes: So now you only
kill the herbicide you only

429
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:18,480
spray where we need to spray the
herbicide. And you can imagine

430
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,200
like you're reducing the cost of
the grower, you're reducing the

431
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,440
the herbicide that's in the
ground, you know, causing

432
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,420
environmental impact. And, and
so and so now in the give the

433
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,270
girl the opportunity to use the
same technology that he's used

434
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,600
to using, but being more
effective and more efficient,

435
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,210
and you give them the
opportunity. I was talking about

436
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,570
the herbicide resistant weeds,
you give them the opportunity to

437
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,560
use different chemicals. Yeah,
that's right. That's right.

438
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,200
Because before you sprayed
everything, so you have to use

439
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,050
an editing modified herbicide in
crops, because you want to be

440
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,320
able to spray everything, you
don't want the crop to die. Now

441
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,380
if I can just tell you, I can
just hit just the wheat and not

442
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,590
everything else. Now you can use
different chemicals, different

443
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,830
herbicides to target the week.
There you go.

444
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,520
Audrow Nash: Now do you need to
use genetically modified crops

445
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,900
for this? Because you're killing
things in the same field with

446
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,750
some sort of herbicide? Or like,
do you want them to be slightly

447
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,410
resistant to it? So that
something in their system is not

448
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:27,150
like say you spray this one weed
in this field of cash crop? And

449
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,180
does that impact negatively the
cash crop that's around it? Or

450
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:38,160
is it a small enough and precise
enough dose? That it just kills

451
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,790
the weed and doesn't damage the
crops? Or is it a trade off

452
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,450
between the two.

453
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,590
Unknown: So nothing's ever
perfect, right? So there's It

454
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:50,100
depends, depends on the cash
crop, you're using some cash

455
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,840
crops, you, you want to be able
to, you want to be able to

456
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,200
genetically modify them so that
you can spray the crop as well

457
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,340
as the week. And then depending
on depending on the cash crop

458
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,190
itself, you don't want to spray
it at all, you want to spray

459
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,600
justly. And so and you think
about you know, the situations

460
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,800
and the variances of fields, the
variances of crop types, the

461
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,890
variances of wheat, you know,
you have all those different

462
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,860
things, and depending on the
situation, you want to apply a

463
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:25,020
system that works for your
situation, right. And so the

464
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:31,350
focus of Blue River, and John
Deere in overall is to give the

465
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:36,960
customer the ability to tailor
their system to their situation.

466
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,680
And give them a system that that
effectively will work for them,

467
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,860
given the situation. So some
situations you can genetically

468
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,280
modify, spray, just the wheat
and a little bit of the crop and

469
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,430
it doesn't hurt some situations
you want to be able to spray,

470
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,850
you want to target test that
weed only and you don't want to

471
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,930
spray the crop at all.

472
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,390
Audrow Nash: One thing just to
clear up: Would you talk a bit

473
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,210
about the relationship between
Blue River and John Deere.

474
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,310
Because we mentioned it but just
to like explicitly talk about

475
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,330
how they are related.

476
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,640
Unknown: So Blue River was
around right there was a startup

477
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,790
company I talked to you about
the founders. Yeah. And and

478
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:22,050
eventually they you know, not
just John Deere, but other

479
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,440
agricultural companies were
interested in purchasing Blue

480
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,880
River and I think John Deere won
that war, the war if you will,

481
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,540
and

482
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,310
Audrow Nash: It's nice to have a
bidding war.

483
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,860
Unknown: Sure. So the use of the
technology and the viableness,

484
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:43,080
and the need, I think is real,
like it is absolutely 100% a

485
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,290
real problem that's happening
across the world. And it needs

486
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:52,410
to be tackled it like it has to
be tackled. John Deere was was

487
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,830
one of the first people to say
hey, this is a you know, not

488
00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:01,980
just not even just this
particular problem with the

489
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,920
herbicide resistance,

490
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,000
Audrow Nash: Yeah, yeah.

491
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,920
Unknown: Just, you know,
applying artificial intelligence

492
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:14,580
and in high tech, high tech, you
know, things into the

493
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,120
agriculture, agricultural world,
that now that's a new thing,

494
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,420
right like that these these,
these companies, you know, John

495
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,470
Deere particularly, have been
operating and using, you know,

496
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:30,690
machines for for, you know,
hundreds of years. And they have

497
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,770
grown a Technic technological
advances, but, you know, they

498
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:38,070
haven't been implementing, you
know, artificial intelligence

499
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,360
and, you know, high definition
cameras and high, you know, a

500
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,920
very high power computers. Yeah.
And so, so making the next step,

501
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,740
I think John Deere thinking
about making the next step, and

502
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,340
where does agriculture have to
grow, you know, and for the

503
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,390
future, to continue to sustain
and to continue to maintain, you

504
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:01,590
know, for the population that we
have on this earth, that these

505
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:05,400
technologies need to be in, you
know, integrated into the

506
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:10,110
agricultural industry, and saw
Blue River as you know, what the

507
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:14,160
way that we want to tackle the
problem using AI, using very

508
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,280
high performance computers,
using, you know, advanced

509
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,140
technologies, you know, they in
robotics, they saw that this was

510
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,200
a nice day, this was a nice, a
nice integration into their

511
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,680
company, gotcha them to give
them the ability to, you know,

512
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,390
to use robotics to robota size,
if you will, their machinery

513
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,450
that they had already had, that
they already built, they already

514
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:36,930
make.

515
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:43,650
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So we then
see, we're spraying herbicide on

516
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:51,540
the weeds in a cash crop, a row
cash crop field, is this kind of

517
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,320
the, I guess, where does Blue
River go from there before being

518
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,150
acquired by John Deere? Or is
that is that kind of the core

519
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,350
competence of the company?

520
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,480
Unknown: So So we essentially,
you know, the mentality is give

521
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,180
me up to give the, the CRO or
the plant by plant knowledge, so

522
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,880
that they can make a smart
decision. Right, so we have

523
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,580
cameras, we have artificial
intelligence, we have the

524
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,030
ability to make real time
decisions using robotics, right?

525
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,750
So we use robotics to be able to
say, hey, real time, this is

526
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:29,130
what this plant needs. And that
was Blue River, and still is,

527
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,230
it's blue rivers, you know,
driving force, you know, you can

528
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,250
look at the plant real time and
decide right there. What does

529
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,610
this guy need. And that is, you
know, when you, when you think

530
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:45,780
about any, any person who's in
agriculture, or, you know,

531
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,080
planning biology, they will tell
you, the plants that grow the

532
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,610
best are the ones that are taken
care of individually, this plant

533
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,860
needs this, this one needs a
little bit of pruning, this one

534
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,560
needs some fertilizer, this one
needs, he has weeds growing

535
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,310
around it. So Blue River was
allowing you to do that and, you

536
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:06,630
know, skill level, you know, not
not your pot in your house, you

537
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:09,960
know, where you kind of hand
doing in the field, in the field

538
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,580
and 1000s of acres with a
machine, you know, that you can

539
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,640
just kind of let it do its
thing. And you as the grower

540
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,160
don't have to sit there and do
that.

541
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,530
Audrow Nash: And is it only is
it only spraying plants? Is it

542
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,530
also trimming or any of these
other things that you've

543
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,100
mentioned.

544
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,890
Unknown: So you can you can
imagine the technology can be

545
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:36,030
advanced, if the original, you
know, this initial, like

546
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:40,020
induction into the market is
spraying plants for herbicides,

547
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,810
because that is a very prevalent
problem. And it's something that

548
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:46,020
Blue River was already doing.
But you can imagine.

549
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,210
Audrow Nash: It's cool, because
you can retrofit existing

550
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,950
systems. So that's very nice.

551
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,270
Tobias Holmes: Retrofitting
existing systems, developing new

552
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:58,410
systems that are very, you know,
optimized. Yeah. Then and then

553
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,610
extending the see and sense
technology, kind of like, you

554
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,920
know, we talked about this a
little bit, you know, seeing and

555
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,720
think and actuate, your podcast.
That's exactly what Blue River,

556
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,130
you know, long term, you know,
overall, that's the goal is to

557
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,330
be able to sense the
environment, do something smart,

558
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,260
and then actually do something
smart to the ground or do some

559
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,120
smart and get world sense. This
is exactly what your podcast

560
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,440
says and think about it, think
about agriculture, all the

561
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,990
different things that you have
to do, you have to plant the

562
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,900
seed, you have to take care of
the seed when it's down in the

563
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,810
ground at the fertilizer, you
have to weed it, and then you

564
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,270
have to harvest it, and then you
take it from harvest and you

565
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:45,300
have to get it out to the market
so that they can be sold. So

566
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,140
there's just a lot as there's a
wealth of, of tech, you know,

567
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,520
this, the agriculture industry
is just I won't say behind but

568
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,610
just has been doing things a
certain way for a long time and

569
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:01,230
it's a fertile ground. For new
technology for New for new ways

570
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,560
to go about to bring that that
sense. And they can actually

571
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,980
wait, you know, paradigm into
that world. There's, there's

572
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,500
just oh my god, it's just so
many different ways and

573
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,230
opportunities. Yeah, that's
absolutely right, John, John

574
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,320
Deere and Uber are being
acquired by John Deere to get us

575
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,900
right in the forefront of it.
Because, you know, that's the

576
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,050
one of the biggest agriculture
companies in the world. And, and

577
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,690
so and they do all that they do
everything, you know, from

578
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,860
planting, to harvesting to, you
know, to tilling the ground to

579
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,220
getting it prepared, and as well
as other industries

580
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,980
construction. Forestry.

581
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,290
Audrow Nash: So what do you what
do you mean? Oh, are you saying

582
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,280
John Deere does these?

583
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,490
Tobias Holmes: Yes, yes, yes,
John Deere. And so Blue River,

584
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,420
you know, bringing in the sense
and think kind of a mind frame,

585
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:49,740
into an industry and until a
company that already has its

586
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,460
footprint across our world and
all established? That's right,

587
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:53,760
all.

588
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,920
Audrow Nash: And they're,
they're I mean, they're domain

589
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,820
experts at the actual markets
that they're servicing. So

590
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,420
agriculture, and then other ones
you mentioned. So then

591
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,450
partnering with them, where you
guys are being you're helping on

592
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:11,850
the sensing and thinking side,
and then they can kind of use

593
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:14,730
their existing systems are
retrofit your systems into it,

594
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,160
or even add your systems design
your systems

595
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,670
Unknown: Integrate them,
exactly. Really great, really at

596
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,970
the foundational level, right?
Let's develop new systems. But

597
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:27,240
let's rethink how we do this. We
know how we do it already.

598
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,170
Right? But we do it, we did it
already with previous Well, you

599
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,200
know, what previous experience,
now let's bring in this new

600
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,680
technology, and let's rethink
how we could do it. You know, if

601
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,680
we, if we bring in, you know,
different sensors, cameras,

602
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:47,130
lasers, and sensors, you know,
smart algorithms, and different,

603
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,860
you know, different ways to
actuate in different ways to go

604
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,280
about doing something. And then
now, you know, and now change

605
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,500
the future, right? Like, you
know, you could just think about

606
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,280
all the different ways, you
know, that AI Robotics has

607
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,440
changed the world, and it's
gonna continue to check the

608
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,220
world, you know, before you have
to have a human in the loop,

609
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,950
right? Yeah, human beings,
humans just do it fast,

610
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,670
literally, when it's asked. And
now, you know, you can provide a

611
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,430
smarter machine that can do that
can do this task.

612
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,490
Audrow Nash: Or one person can
do a bunch of fields and

613
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,130
effectively have a bunch of
like, robot workers on the

614
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:24,150
tractor doing the hard manual
things. Absolutely. Very

615
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:30,720
focused, intensive. Absolutely.
Let's see. And then. So with

616
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:39,750
Blue River? What? Wait, so I'm
just curious, I guess, how was

617
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:45,030
it? You were around? When John
Deere purchased? Blue River?

618
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:49,980
Correct? That's correct. Yes.
How, how have things felt to

619
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:54,570
you, as things have changed with
that? Like, how is the focus

620
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:57,510
changed? Or what kind of
problems are you guys working

621
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:01,410
on? What's interesting about
being acquired, and the process

622
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:01,860
of that?

623
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,040
Tobias Holmes: I think it's,
it's very, like, for me,

624
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,800
personally, it's been very
interesting just to see a

625
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,390
company transition from you
know, very, you know, startup,

626
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,030
you know, environment, you know,
get out there and fire in the

627
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:18,660
belly, we got to make something
we got to continue to, you know,

628
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,950
develop this product that people
are interested in, grow into

629
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:26,070
now, you've been acquired by a
company, that is totally has the

630
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,860
resources to make sure that you
grow, but we need to grow it in

631
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,070
a direction that is actually
going to be viable, and actually

632
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:35,250
going to be, you know, a product
is actually going to be put out

633
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:40,230
to market, and customers are
going to receive and use, and,

634
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:46,200
and having all of that expertise
and that knowledge of all those

635
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,630
years of John Deere
manufacturing, agricultural

636
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:52,770
sprayers, and any piece of
agriculture milled with the high

637
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:55,890
technology. And you could you
could already think that there's

638
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:59,610
going to be a lot of challenges,
right? That's a two, not

639
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:02,430
necessarily two different
worlds. But you know, you know,

640
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:05,910
kind of different environments
kind of have to mesh together.

641
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,930
And I praise John Deere, for
giving us the ability to kind of

642
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,310
keep our autonomy as far as
developing the technology and

643
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:18,480
going as fast as we can to
continue to develop it and grow

644
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,190
it and, and make changes as we
need. But keep us kind of, you

645
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,370
know, I would call it. What do
you call that leadership and

646
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:31,230
management? You know, John Deere
has this division, right? This

647
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:35,130
is where this thing needs to get
funneled into. You guys have the

648
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:38,460
ability to do whatever you think
needs to be able needs to be

649
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,610
done in order to accomplish
this, this goal here and we're

650
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:46,200
trying to accomplish and the
goal is big enough and broad

651
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,100
enough, right? That it
encompasses all the things that

652
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,430
they're doing, right? It
compasses, not just the sprayer

653
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:56,670
part, which is just as one part
that we're working on. And

654
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,550
probably the first thing that
will roll out, just because

655
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:03,720
we're Were Blue River was the
most mature in the area. Yeah,

656
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:07,950
but but we could, but we're
already developing other areas.

657
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:13,020
And so And so John Deere just
has a great vision has the great

658
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,390
wherewithal. And I think because
they have acquired companies

659
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,920
that just have all the
experience, are they the

660
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,150
company's been around for years,
they know, you know, the ability

661
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,140
and the way that they they went
about the acquisition after it

662
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,830
happened, and the way that
they're slowly bringing a sense

663
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:32,010
of their, into their
environment, and so their world,

664
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:36,240
but still allowing us to be Blue
River, I think is great. And I

665
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,570
think it says kudos to them.
Because they could have totally

666
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,210
just came in and say, Hey, boom,
we bought everything we own

667
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:45,300
everything you got, they're
gonna do his like how he said,

668
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:48,270
and they didn't do that. They,
they, they, they said, hey, they

669
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,940
appreciate you guys have
something special here going on.

670
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,820
We don't want to affect that.
Want to allow you guys to

671
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,880
continue to do that. But we want
you to do it in this direction.

672
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:01,230
Yeah, in any directions aligned,
which I think is another, you

673
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:04,980
know, smart thing on them. And I
think what Blue River as well,

674
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:08,700
to reason why we got acquired by
John Deere is because the

675
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,480
directions aligned very well. So
and so it was like, Yeah, this

676
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,150
is gonna work. Right. This is
gonna work, you know, kudos to

677
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:20,580
our CEO, for you know, navigate
that because Yeah, absolutely.

678
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:23,250
Absolutely. You know, making
those making those things

679
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,010
happen. And then he's still
around, right, like our CEO

680
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:29,940
still here or is still doing
job. You're still managing he

681
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,720
still going? You know, very
important things for us. Yeah.

682
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,410
And, yeah, we can say that this
is working out pretty pretty

683
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:37,980
nicely. I

684
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,970
Audrow Nash: Hell yeah, so what
was the timeline? So founding of

685
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:45,270
Blue River acquired by John
Deere...

686
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:51,630
Unknown: We got founded 10 years
ago, that's, what this is 21, so

687
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:57,240
2011. Yeah. So and then. And
then, we got acquired by Deere

688
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:02,010
in 2017. So that's what six
years after the founding, they

689
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:08,160
got acquired by dear God. Yeah.
And so here we are 2021, four

690
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,410
years after acquisition. Still,
still going well, and probably

691
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:17,970
going to bring the first product
to market. Two years from now.

692
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,520
Audrow Nash: Two years? Can you
talk a bit about that? Or is

693
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,600
that a secret?

694
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:28,080
Unknown: I can say that it's
coming. That's about it. I mean,

695
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:32,910
not any details, but it's, yeah,
the first, the first product

696
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,500
will be is coming soon.

697
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,610
Audrow Nash: Nice. That'll be
exciting. So then, can you tell

698
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:43,050
me a bit about your experience?
So you, you Quality Manager,

699
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,020
Quality Assurance Manager? Can
you tell me a bit about what

700
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,800
that means? And I mean, I've
been in academia most of my

701
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,520
time, so we don't really have
this, would you tell me a bit

702
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,140
about your job as a quality
manager?

703
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:59,670
Unknown: Absolutely. So, so
Quality Manager is, you know,

704
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,330
this is an essential part of the
business is to make sure that

705
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:07,770
the customer receives, you know,
value in that product, and that

706
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:11,190
the product that they get is
what they expect, not only what

707
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:15,000
they expect, hopefully it sees
expectations, but But you know,

708
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,530
first and fundamentally is what
they expect. And, and so it's

709
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:24,870
making sure you know, I think
about it this way, you can have

710
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:29,790
the startup mind frame, you
know, and just really just gone,

711
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:34,020
you read this, move fast and
break things with us break

712
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,660
things, you put something out
there, but there's all kinds of

713
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,080
bugs with it. And depending on
your market, and depending on

714
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,510
the customer, you think you
think about your, you think

715
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:48,210
about these phones, you know, 20
years ago, and they and they had

716
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,480
all kinds of bugs and issues
with them. But the customer you

717
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,920
were dealing with was okay with
that right? There early adapters

718
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,090
are okay, yeah, I can I can I oh
yeah, I gotta do this thing, or

719
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:03,210
I got to press it two times this
way and do this in that way. And

720
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:07,050
then it finally works. Right?
You know, so that that was fine

721
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,600
for that environment. But for
our particular customer, you

722
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,990
know, agriculture customer, they
want to bring in John Deere, you

723
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:17,370
know, name recognition. You
know, it just works. John Deere

724
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:22,110
has the reputation in the in
the, you know, the cloud that

725
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,130
when I get a bite when I buy a
John Deere, it works out of the

726
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:30,390
box, I turn the key, it does
what I wanted to do. And if

727
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:34,140
anything is wrong, they fix it
Johnny on the spot, no big deal.

728
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:39,330
High quality high, you know, I
pay a premium, because it is the

729
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:43,710
high quality product. It's the
best, right? It's one of its, I

730
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,470
would say it's the best, right?
It's the best that you're going

731
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,580
to get. And so how do we
maintain that right? How do you

732
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:55,140
know John Deere has maintained
that over years, over centuries?

733
00:44:55,410 --> 00:45:00,210
How do we maintain that and so
my job is to allow blu rays For

734
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,470
developers, the ability to
continue to grow to continually

735
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:07,920
to develop this product and
continue to iterate and make it

736
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,730
better, you know, the Bay Area
Silicon Valley, quickly area

737
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,360
area can fail. But when we
release something out, or

738
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:20,310
release something out to the to
the, to the customer, it is it

739
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:23,850
has that John Deere quality it
has that this is going to work,

740
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:27,540
it is robust, it is going to do
what you guys told me it was

741
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,110
going to do. So I'm the kind of
the gatekeeper. I'm like, yeah,

742
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:34,380
go develop all that cool stuff,
go get in the lab, go write your

743
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,350
code. Let's get out here in the
field. Let's go test it. Let's

744
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,380
go. Let's come up with all the
cool things that we can. But

745
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,440
this is what we can release.
This is what we can, this is

746
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,070
what we can give out. Because
it's ready. If it ain't ready

747
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:50,370
yet, you know, hey, it's not
ready yet, guys, we gotta go

748
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:55,620
back rehash. We, you know,
reiterate. You know, and so and

749
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,200
so I want to allow those guys
the ability to continue to

750
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,840
reiterate and continue to
develop product, you know,

751
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,950
features and things, but only
allow John Deere quality

752
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:10,710
features got ready to go. And so
that's, that's my that's my

753
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,070
cool, cool. Yeah.

754
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:18,000
Audrow Nash: So does it what
does it look like in a little

755
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,920
more detail? Is it like when I
think of quality assurance

756
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,120
engineers, I mean, I'm at open
robotics, and we have a lot of

757
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,780
software. So quality assurance
for us means like, writing

758
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:35,340
software tests, or making sure
we have certain amount of code

759
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,520
coverage with our tests or
whatever, these kinds of things,

760
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,640
it sounds like your work is a
good bit more applied as in

761
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,790
like, go in the field. Can you
just tell me a bit more about

762
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:45,720
what it involves?

763
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,650
Tobias Holmes: It's that right?
Is that and but But you said you

764
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:53,820
said exactly. It's definitely
you know, unit test, you know,

765
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:58,170
code coverage of things in the
software stack, right. But it's

766
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:01,110
not just a software piece of
equipment, it's a robotic piece

767
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:04,350
of equipment. Yeah, and so and
so it has to actually perform

768
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:07,680
out in the field. So there's
more things than just does the

769
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,980
algorithm behave the way we
expect, but just the mechanical

770
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:15,150
devices to behave the way we
expect, can can the cameras and

771
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:18,540
the wires and the things hold up
to the environment that we're

772
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:23,190
going to throw them in. And then
again, I said earlier about, we

773
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:26,370
gave the customer the ability to
use a platform that they were

774
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:29,970
already used to using. And
they're already used to use it

775
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:32,820
in a certain way. So they
already used to have in this

776
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:36,900
sprayer that I parked out on the
corner over here, and it rains

777
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,860
on it, and it it snows on it, if
depending on what part of the

778
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:44,040
country you're in, you got it
that the environment you're

779
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:47,880
paying to it, but I can turn
that key next season. And it

780
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,690
goes and it does its job. So
making sure that all of the

781
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,960
pieces and all the all of the
parts come together the

782
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,610
integration, in a way in a way
that that when that customer is

783
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:04,050
actually my North Star is
customer turns, the key thing

784
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:07,710
does what it's supposed to do,
or at least tells you hey, you

785
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:10,260
need to go do something, you
need to go do something right,

786
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,800
you know, your camera cables,
have fried over this past

787
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,280
season, go replace them, you
know, and so making sure that

788
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:20,910
all of those things are there,
the quality is there in and of

789
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:23,970
itself. And when it isn't there,
it is very obvious to the

790
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:27,960
customer, what it is they need
to go through to fix it. And so

791
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,740
it's it's you know, it's unit
testing, it's called coverage,

792
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:35,670
like a software company that has
those features. But it's more

793
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:38,100
customer focused, it's more,
it's more customer focused. So

794
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,690
we definitely have to go out and
test it on the machine and give

795
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:47,700
it real machine time. Yes, see,
to see what the customer is

796
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,890
going to experience and give
them the best experience we can

797
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:50,160
get.

798
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:54,090
Audrow Nash: Okay, I'm curious
about the hardware side of this.

799
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:59,160
How do you deal with software,
if I write tests to constrain my

800
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,470
code to make sure that it's
working, the tests fail if the

801
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:05,070
code is not working? And then I
just run these frequently. And I

802
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:10,680
can tell if my code is working
over time. What do you do? So

803
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:14,040
that that, to me is clear for
software? How do you test

804
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:17,790
hardware to make sure that or
even like hardware and software

805
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:22,410
and their integration together?
How do you guys do this? Yeah,

806
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:27,030
no, I'm sure. I've seen like
with Boston Dynamics, or some

807
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:30,210
robotics company, they'll just
have their robot do the paces.

808
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:33,750
So they'll have it run and move
continuously for a week or

809
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:37,530
something like this. But can you
speak a little bit about this?

810
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,130
How do you...

811
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,550
Tobias Holmes: I mean, I think
it's essentially the same

812
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:45,090
similar things. I mean, I won't
get into the details of exactly

813
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:49,620
how, but it is something along
those lines, right, we run we

814
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:53,070
run that system through the
paces, if you will, I can't give

815
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:57,090
you all the details, because
that is it is essentially the

816
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:02,100
John Deere name, their
reliability and The and the you

817
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:07,380
know, the the the confidence you
get from saying that I bought a

818
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:11,520
John Deere and I know this thing
is gonna work. This is part of

819
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,540
their secret sauce as part of
their, you know, this is how we

820
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:20,100
this is how we got to be who we
are. And the I would say I will

821
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,160
say this, the nice thing about
being acquired by them is that

822
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,390
we were able to be brought in.
And so that process of how they

823
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:31,470
ensure reliability and quality
to the customer. And we could

824
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:34,740
add that in and that and I think
they you know, a lot of

825
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,900
startups, not every startup, you
know, there's always gonna be

826
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,480
great startups, they're always
gonna, you know, hurry up and

827
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,100
fail, and then figure out the
quality. To do that, and they're

828
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,560
gonna raise it, yeah, they're
gonna do it, right, they're

829
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,620
gonna figure out oh, that didn't
work, change it up real quick.

830
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,920
That works now change it up. And
depending on the customer base,

831
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:56,250
you have a lot of units, you
have a lot of room to do that,

832
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:58,590
especially if it's new
technology that's never been,

833
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,670
you know, out there, and your
customer base is like open to

834
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:07,290
it. You know, our customer base
isn't so much open to things

835
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:11,250
that don't work, it has to work.
And so John Deere is very, you

836
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:16,020
know, keen on that. And, and so
all the 50 did a good job of

837
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,230
bringing us in allowing a
startup to see how did you

838
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:24,210
change transform from making
this cool technology that works?

839
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:26,910
You know, at first, you know, we
talked about you could talk

840
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:30,900
about when you develop
something, you know, is that 95%

841
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:35,010
edge cases are the maker
breakers, right? You can make

842
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:41,010
something that works 80 85% of
the time, the 9095, you know,

843
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:45,450
the 9798, those ones are your
problems that take the most

844
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:49,770
time, right. So those edge
cases, and John Deere has a has

845
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:55,860
a method for that. And so and so
we and so we work, right, we

846
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:58,230
continue to work, and we
continue to develop the product.

847
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:02,340
I can't get into any of the
details other than that, like

848
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:07,680
you said very clearly is that
you continue to test that system

849
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,850
and method, you have a method of
doing it. So that you know that

850
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:16,290
when the time you release it. It
is ready. It's ready for the

851
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:20,910
customer is ready to accept it
is not is a perfect? No. It's

852
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:24,210
that there's no perfect no no
perfection. Oh, of course. Yeah.

853
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:28,290
But you have all you have all
you have all the big things out.

854
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,230
And then the rest of it is
there's a system to have the

855
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:31,800
rest.

856
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:37,170
Audrow Nash: So is there. So it
sounds to me, like a lot of your

857
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:42,720
job might involve figure making
decisions about what can and

858
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,740
cannot be included? Can you talk
a little bit to this, I'm sure

859
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:50,040
it has something to do with the
John Deere process. But also,

860
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:55,530
it's a value judgment. On your
side, I imagine where you're

861
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:59,670
going, we need it to be good for
this temperature range, or

862
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:00,180
whatever it is.

863
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,900
Unknown: That's right, that, you
know, it's essential, right?

864
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:07,170
Like, there's specifications,
and there's, there's certain

865
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:11,460
things that are, you know, go
no, go, I try to be very clear

866
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:15,720
on that. And then, and the other
part of my job is when that is

867
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:19,140
included, define some things are
just clear. This is good enough,

868
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:22,020
and this isn't. And then there's
some things that are like, Okay,

869
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:25,740
this is a gray area, you know,
we don't have a really clearly

870
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,910
defined.

871
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,170
Audrow Nash: Can you give me an
example?

872
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:33,780
Unknown: So, so, let's think
about the technology, right?

873
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,780
Think about artificial
intelligence, artificial

874
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:40,170
intelligence, you know, it's
probability, you know, so you

875
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:43,260
have these, like, you know,
these algorithms and these

876
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:47,160
metrics that say, okay, hey,
we're about this percentage,

877
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:50,730
good, on on our detection of...

878
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:55,380
Audrow Nash: So maybe like, I'm
95% confident that this is a

879
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,160
tomato plant.

880
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:02,310
Unknown: There you go. 95%, is
95 going to be good enough? Do

881
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:05,640
we really need to be 97 or is
that is that, where was that

882
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:11,310
number? And that's hard to say?
And you think about the world,

883
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:14,160
right? This these machines can
be anywhere in the world, that

884
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,760
various changes depending on
where you are. So you're over

885
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,590
here and this part of the
country or this part of the

886
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,040
world, that's good enough and
other parts of the country of

887
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,180
the world or particular actually
even a particular actual grower,

888
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:31,320
that's not good enough, I need
this thing to be this well, or

889
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,570
otherwise, I'll just go I'll
just go by the other thing.

890
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:39,150
Audrow Nash: So work. So I'm
thinking like, okay, considering

891
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:42,600
you guys are in like all over
the world, you have machines all

892
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:47,520
over the world. I'm imagining
knowing that if you're using

893
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:54,810
some sort of like probabilistic
machine learning AI thing for

894
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,370
identifying plants or weeds,
there's probably a good amount

895
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,890
of variation in We there's a
good amount of variation in the

896
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:04,470
type of lighting you're get
during the day, there's a good

897
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:09,270
variation in the amount, or like
the color of the soil, or the

898
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:13,470
makeup of the soil, or anything
like this. And this would

899
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:17,910
probably make it depending on
the method you're using. A good

900
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:22,230
bit more difficult to come up
with metrics, I guess, yeah,

901
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,900
this would be a good gray area
examples, right?

902
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,530
Unknown: That's exactly why I
brought it up. Because, okay, it

903
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:32,310
depends, right? It depends on,
like, all those things you said,

904
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:37,170
right. And probably oil more
than environment, the lighting

905
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:40,710
condition and what condition
you're in. And in, I think the

906
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:43,530
moisture important, the
important piece that I talked

907
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:49,920
about what quality is, is under
letting the customer know, how,

908
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:54,390
what quality you're getting.
Right. And so being able to

909
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:58,140
communicate that, I think that's
an key, I think that will be key

910
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,080
in the future of robotics, as
well, as we continue to develop

911
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:05,190
the technology. There will be
situations where there's an

912
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:10,590
expectation, and now we cannot
guarantee you what you'd expect.

913
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:14,910
And so you know, we tell you,
Hey, you're in a situation now

914
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:18,810
that we're using fuzzy
probability mathematics. And

915
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:22,170
yeah, your numbers are are
starting to below come below a

916
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:27,120
threshold, yet. So now it is up
to you as the union user to say,

917
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:32,310
Can I keep going this way? Or?
No? I think that is, I think

918
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:34,680
that's I think that's going to
be I think that's going to

919
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:39,810
always be the case, for a long
time in robotics. And so we can

920
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:43,980
get all the edge cases out of
out of a particular application.

921
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,430
And well, how many robotic
applications do we actually have

922
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:51,780
in the world? There's not a lot
of. And so as we develop these

923
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,910
new novel ones, though, they'll
need time...

924
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,270
Audrow Nash: ...to mature even
more and become more reliable.

925
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:05,280
Okay, does it mean, you go and
test the robot system in a

926
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,580
similar environment to what the
customer is, and then measure

927
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:11,280
how effective it is, and then
report that to the customer? I

928
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,340
assume it's not like a real
time, this is how well, we're

929
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:19,080
doing. system when you're
talking about telling the

930
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,360
customers quality information.

931
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:25,590
Unknown: So it's both it's,
it's, it's actually some there's

932
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:29,130
some real time to it right?
There has to be there has to be

933
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:33,420
in particular, it's a robotic
system, you have to let the

934
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:37,680
customer know, like, as real
time as you can, that we're not

935
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:40,410
getting like you're not
behaving, you're not behaving

936
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:44,370
the way that you want to behave.
Yeah, so you got to be able to

937
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:46,440
give them that you have to be
able to give them that.

938
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:49,230
Audrow Nash: Okay, I guess I'm a
little confused, because I'm

939
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:54,030
imagining like, a robotic system
going and spraying plants. And

940
00:57:54,030 --> 00:58:00,180
maybe it says, we hit 80% of the
weeds. But the thing is, at the

941
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:04,680
time, it thought every one of
which it sprayed was a weed. So

942
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,740
20% might have been the cash
crop or something like this.

943
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:14,460
Unknown: So the secret sauce, I
can't give you but but what I

944
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:18,810
can tell you is that you have to
be able to allow the customer to

945
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:23,370
know that your system isn't
behaving the way you expect it

946
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:23,640
to.

947
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:26,130
Audrow Nash: Oh, right. Maybe
it's just being aware of how

948
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:28,470
confident you are about the
things you're doing and

949
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:29,310
reporting that.

950
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:32,670
Tobias Holmes: Exactly. So So
yeah, exactly. Right. Like,

951
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:35,280
Audrow Nash: So it's confidence
based, not outcome, you don't

952
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,980
have any real labels for what
you're doing. Gotcha.

953
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:41,910
Unknown: Well, so so. So it's,
it's so yeah, so it depends,

954
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:45,480
right? It's a combination, I
can't get into all the details

955
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:48,540
yet. But there is a I will put
it like this, there's both

956
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,690
components, there is a real
world component, that is real

957
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:57,840
time. And there's also a a
introspected after the fact, you

958
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,900
know, but you know that you can
go back and look at and you can

959
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,830
and then you can combined.
Right? So so I'll put it to you

960
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:08,910
like this, if you ran over a
field once, if you've already

961
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,930
kind of been through an area
once. And then you go back

962
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:16,470
through it again, you know that
that provides you ability to

963
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:18,570
make different kinds of
decisions.

964
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:22,050
Audrow Nash: You get to see if
the weeds were all killed, or if

965
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,550
there's a bunch of them still
or...

966
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:28,230
Unknown: Where the weeds are?
What, what's the density of

967
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:31,800
them, you know, how the machines
behaving at the time when you go

968
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,010
through that part of the field?
There's lots of different

969
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:35,490
things.

970
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,290
Audrow Nash: Cool, okay, I
didn't consider that kind of

971
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:38,910
temporal part of this.

972
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:41,670
Unknown: There's lots of
different things that we

973
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:46,020
definitely do both. I would say
we do both something real time

974
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,390
because you want to allow the
customer to know right away that

975
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:52,770
hey, you're not in a great
situation. And but then there's

976
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:57,600
also like, what is the situation
exactly in that area? What is

977
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,350
actually going on? Why isn't
that a great situation? And then

978
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,250
how do we correct for it? How do
we make it better? How do we

979
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:08,460
improve upon it? And so yeah,
providing the customer with the

980
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,490
ability to do that. And so those
are two, I would say, those are

981
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:15,720
two things that I constantly
have to make sure that we're

982
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:20,190
doing. And you know, it's cool,
because we're developing both,

983
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:24,150
right, we're developing both of
those infrastructures. Now real

984
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:27,450
time, like, you know, and so
when that product gets released,

985
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:30,960
you don't present the customer
ability to do both, he can say,

986
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,470
hey, right now, this is what's
going on, what do I do? He can

987
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:37,620
make a decision, or she can make
a decision on what do I want to

988
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:42,420
do now? After the fact that can
come back and say, hey, that's

989
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,390
what happened at that time? How
do the next time we go through

990
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:49,290
that situation again, time
better, gotten better prepared

991
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:51,510
and better to make a better
decision? You know, what new

992
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:56,160
information? And then and then
you know, that, that turns on

993
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:01,740
another, you know, opportunity
or ability in ways to, to tackle

994
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,890
it, you know, versus the real
time real time you're making a

995
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:09,300
decision right now. You know,
planning ahead of time is always

996
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,850
better, right? If you can plan
ahead for that's always better.

997
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,100
Audrow Nash: Now, would you talk
a little bit about doing work in

998
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:21,240
the field for this kind of
thing, or like, getting out in

999
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,930
the field and testing your
systems? Just I think that's a

1000
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:28,980
very interesting part of what it
sounds like your job involves?

1001
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:32,040
Tobias Holmes: Yeah, absolutely.
So we had to get out in the

1002
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:36,630
field. And I got a team of
people, you know, and also in

1003
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:41,220
coordination, not with just my
QA team, but the the, the field

1004
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:45,630
team, that's always out on the
machine is always out there. And

1005
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:49,830
being able to, to understand how
the machine actually behaves in

1006
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:54,840
the field. And so, you know,
that it's not the same thing as,

1007
01:01:55,050 --> 01:02:00,900
like an iPhone, or, you know, a
piece of software that's

1008
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:04,050
presented in a web server, it's
an actual piece of equipment

1009
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:08,520
that's put in the field, and
another customer uses it, you

1010
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:12,660
know, puts their hands on it,
and, and actually gets out there

1011
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:17,760
and use Google ads. So it's very
valuable to me to get the

1012
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:23,130
customer's input the customer's
point of view, the novel use

1013
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:26,970
cases. So putting out something
in the field with a customer,

1014
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,330
you know, you have in your mind
as an engineer and the

1015
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:33,780
engineering team, this is how we
think you should be using our

1016
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:36,780
product. And the customer will
just say, Oh, I can do this,

1017
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:39,450
this and this, and totally
something you didn't even think

1018
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:43,500
about. You don't even think oh,
wow, well, I didn't know that

1019
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,750
you're going to go through this.
Because, you know, we didn't

1020
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:49,140
design it for that. But it can
totally be done in that way.

1021
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:53,880
And, and so that's always cool
to get their their point of view

1022
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,550
to get their use cases, because
then we can start to think

1023
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:59,250
about, oh, wow, this could be
used this way. We didn't even

1024
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:03,060
think about that. But let's make
sure that way works. Let's make

1025
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:06,180
sure that that way works,
because now we know, right? They

1026
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:08,460
want to use it that way. Yeah,
they want to use it that way.

1027
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:13,590
I'm putting it out in as many I
think any company wants to put

1028
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:19,530
their product and all the as
many environments and use cases

1029
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:24,720
as they can to get the 97 98%.
Because you don't know, right?

1030
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,690
Somebody is using it this way.
You have your describe where you

1031
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:31,950
want to use it. And you don't
know, you know what those edge

1032
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:35,370
cases are in your software
stack, your mechanicals that,

1033
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,320
you know, of what's what what
did we break down at? Were we

1034
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,800
not good enough that, you know,
and, and so if you don't get out

1035
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,820
there, and you don't give
yourself the ability to to, to

1036
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:51,360
do it in as many different
environments as you can, you're

1037
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,850
going to find an environment
that you didn't prepare for that

1038
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:57,120
you're not capable of handling.
And you just have to figure that

1039
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:01,740
out later. So we're, we're keen
on, you know, and the nice thing

1040
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:04,380
about being acquired by John
Deere is we can go a lot of

1041
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:07,620
places across the country and
across the world to make sure

1042
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:12,750
we're getting the big slots of
use cases.

1043
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:19,980
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Cool. Let's
see, blowing up a little bit. Or

1044
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:24,450
going up a few levels. What do
you think? Where do you think

1045
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:27,510
robotics and agriculture is
headed?

1046
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:33,030
Tobias Holmes: I think you know,
you know, robotics in general is

1047
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:37,080
the future of all industries.
Agriculture is going to totally,

1048
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:41,580
you know, 20 years from now it's
going to dominate. There's going

1049
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:44,910
to there's going to be you know,
these machines will be

1050
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:51,660
automated, and, and, you know,
self sufficient, you know, 2030

1051
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:57,360
years from now, or a girl will
be able to say, hey, I want this

1052
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:01,470
to happen on my land, and it
will happen and it will be very

1053
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:04,230
little human input. You know,
there'll be there'll be some

1054
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:08,280
spots for human input. But you
know, unless someone from

1055
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:13,200
Congress or somebody, you know,
artificially removes the stress

1056
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,910
that is going to grow. I mean,
it's the only way for these

1057
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:21,120
things to grow, right? Like
there's, there's ton of machines

1058
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:25,530
as Thailand, we have to feed in
a growing population, bunch of

1059
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:28,830
people. Yeah, we have to do that
efficiently as we possibly can.

1060
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,650
We have to take in as much
information as we can about the

1061
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:35,550
ground, what's going on on that
ground? What do we need to do?

1062
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:40,560
How do we get the most out of
it, and then get it ready,

1063
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:44,730
again, season after season, year
after year, and we've been doing

1064
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:49,350
that as humans, but a lot of
human input. And I mean, that

1065
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:54,720
works. But in the future, that's
gonna, it's gonna be less human

1066
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,870
input is going to be a systems
input, because we're finding

1067
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,720
that the system, you know,
systems can can remove that

1068
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:06,720
human input into a better and
more efficient. And so FFI

1069
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,930
anything, you know, fair history
of history says anything, when

1070
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:12,810
we find more efficient and more
effective ways to do something

1071
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:13,620
we do with that way.

1072
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,920
Audrow Nash: Oh, yeah, for sure.
We're, I'm curious to where you

1073
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,080
get the number of 20 to 30
years?

1074
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:22,440
Unknown: It's just the
technology growth? Right. Like,

1075
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,830
it's the, you know, that could
be off, right. I'm giving myself

1076
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:26,520
buffer there.

1077
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:29,280
Audrow Nash: For sure, I'm just
curious about order of

1078
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,000
magnitude.

1079
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,050
Unknown: It's the technology?
It's the ability, you know, so

1080
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:39,480
AI is very, you know, I won't
say it's infant. But applying it

1081
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:43,950
into real world problems is
still fairly new. Yeah, there's

1082
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:46,860
some there's some areas, but
we're talking about agriculture,

1083
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:50,610
agriculture, I think it's still
fairly new, like we were, I

1084
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:54,060
think we're at the cutting edge.
I think blueberries probably

1085
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:57,120
ought to be right, right at
right at front, right. And so

1086
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,560
and so what and where does it
go? And what are the new things

1087
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,020
that we're going to learn? And
how are we going to apply the AI

1088
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:08,370
and the machine learning to this
environment? You know, along

1089
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:12,780
with, you know, the cameras that
can can withstand the rush the

1090
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,750
harsh environment, but still
give you all the information?

1091
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:18,900
Yet all the like you talked
about a little bit earlier, the

1092
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:22,170
cloud changing the lighting
changes the all the things?

1093
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:25,410
Yeah, all the things so much
variance, so much variance. So

1094
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:28,440
you, you put your dino, you
know, it's nice, very controlled

1095
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:32,220
environment, you're in this very
real world natural environment.

1096
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:35,760
How, you know, cameras, just one
thing, you could do this, all

1097
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,840
these other things, right, it's
all the other sensors, and then

1098
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:43,320
the machine and the machinery
and what you're trying to

1099
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:48,960
actually do with that machine.
Can those you know, the human

1100
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,310
hand, right is a, you know, a
very complex, very dynamic piece

1101
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:57,870
of machine, that we still have a
very hard time. robota sizing?

1102
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,750
Yeah, awesome. Dynamics is
pretty cool. Right? I think they

1103
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:04,260
got some pretty nice dynamics,
but I don't think they have a

1104
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:04,950
nice hand.

1105
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:09,420
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Focusing more
on local notion, the local most

1106
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:14,220
universal robots or right hand
robotics or some of these other

1107
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:16,800
gripping, I don't know.

1108
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:19,740
Tobias Holmes: Those gripping
technologies, right. In the

1109
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:23,880
garden. It's been, yeah, it's
really simple. It's for it's for

1110
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,090
the application, right? It's for
the application, right? It's

1111
01:08:27,090 --> 01:08:29,580
like, okay, if I want to grab a
thing I can do I just need a

1112
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:33,360
thing that does this. So that
that mimics some parts of the

1113
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:37,410
hand. Yeah, but the hand can do
so many different things. And

1114
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:41,520
so, you know, just, you know,
how do we do you know, so that's

1115
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:45,570
the mechanical, more complex,
the categorical,

1116
01:08:45,569 --> 01:08:48,089
Audrow Nash: More sophisticated
in the mechanical part? Because

1117
01:08:48,089 --> 01:08:52,769
yeah, you're right, right now we
have very, it's like most very

1118
01:08:52,769 --> 01:08:57,059
fine manipulation. With, in an
environment where you're, like,

1119
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,629
in a highly unstructured
environment doesn't seem to be a

1120
01:09:00,629 --> 01:09:01,529
thing yet.

1121
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,490
Unknown: There's lots of there's
lots of dynamics right? And when

1122
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:07,500
you get when you get out to the
real world talk about

1123
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:11,370
agriculture, you know, that this
this this harvesting companies

1124
01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:15,720
now I think they got robotic,
like, they got he's got suction

1125
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:19,530
things, but he's still suck to
suck the thing with a vacuum.

1126
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:23,340
Right? And so that I can kind of
work in if you can manipulate

1127
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:25,200
it, you know, and you suck it...

1128
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:29,070
Audrow Nash: Little things for
picking strawberries. These

1129
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:31,650
kinds of things. I think I saw
this at the Queensland

1130
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,990
University of Technology in
Australia.

1131
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:37,380
Unknown: You can get in there,
and you can kind of grab it, you

1132
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:41,490
know, and that works in those
environments. But you know,

1133
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:44,220
there's so many diverse
environments.

1134
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:46,980
Audrow Nash: Yeah, it's hard and
not very general. Yeah. At this

1135
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:49,350
point, I believe I mean, I don't
really much.

1136
01:09:50,189 --> 01:09:52,559
Unknown: I think I think
initially there's going to be

1137
01:09:52,559 --> 01:09:56,639
people who are I got a
strawberry grabber, I got an

1138
01:09:56,639 --> 01:10:00,179
apple grabber, and then somebody
is going to make the universal

1139
01:10:00,179 --> 01:10:05,099
So I grab stuff, yeah, whatever
it is, whatever it is, you want

1140
01:10:05,099 --> 01:10:08,039
me to go grab, I go grab it,
right? So the mechanics have to

1141
01:10:08,039 --> 01:10:10,949
get to that point where I can
just grab anything, you know,

1142
01:10:10,949 --> 01:10:14,069
and the human hand can do that.
So I would imagine this, because

1143
01:10:14,069 --> 01:10:17,489
how our brain thinks that we
make stuff that is, you know,

1144
01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:21,419
but then again, with AI, they
might say, Oh, no, your hand is

1145
01:10:21,419 --> 01:10:25,409
not the most optimal grabbing
device, that's other device that

1146
01:10:25,409 --> 01:10:28,439
you can grab, it's completely
different than everything else.

1147
01:10:29,669 --> 01:10:33,509
So that's the other cool thing
that AI brings is the ability to

1148
01:10:33,989 --> 01:10:38,489
rethink about our own, you know,
designs, we come up with these

1149
01:10:38,489 --> 01:10:41,459
designs, and it's like, oh,
that's not the most optimal way

1150
01:10:41,459 --> 01:10:44,099
to build the structure. If you
build the structure with these

1151
01:10:44,099 --> 01:10:47,789
very like, to us, they're not
submitted, we typically build

1152
01:10:47,789 --> 01:10:51,899
symmetrically and you know, the
forces are very nicely applied

1153
01:10:51,899 --> 01:10:55,799
across these symmetrical, you
know, trusses, good things. And

1154
01:10:55,829 --> 01:10:58,619
AI can say, oh, no, if you put
this really long one here, and

1155
01:10:58,619 --> 01:11:03,599
this one here, it has all the
same constraints set as your Is

1156
01:11:03,599 --> 01:11:06,719
there a symmetrical thing that
you've been developing for for

1157
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:08,309
hundreds of years? Are you

1158
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:12,540
Audrow Nash: Are you familiar
with much work? I'm not? But are

1159
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:15,630
you familiar with much work
where it's like design related

1160
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:18,960
things that use some sort of
maybe an evolutionary strategy

1161
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,530
or something in AI? Is this what
you're about?

1162
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:26,790
Unknown: Yeah, we definitely. So
we do some we do some developing

1163
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:30,330
Blue River, right? It's not?
It's not, it's not, you know,

1164
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,180
across the board type of thing,
but we do some of our own of

1165
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:36,540
that, right. And we do sort of
our own, how can AI affect the

1166
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:38,850
design? That's what we do some
of that.

1167
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:45,570
Audrow Nash: Something or, like,
the length of a part of it.

1168
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:48,750
Unknown: No, I think I think it
is just like, you know, you

1169
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:54,420
fundamentally give it a problem.
And, and let it do its thing.

1170
01:11:56,070 --> 01:12:00,480
It's actually like rocket
science. We got some of our guys

1171
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:03,990
are like, you know, smartest
guys ever. And we got some super

1172
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:07,560
smart guys here. Oh, my dad,
and, and, you know, some of

1173
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:12,150
those guys just go out and say,
hey, I want to do this thing

1174
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:15,450
here and give it a problem. I'm
gonna let the I'm gonna let AI

1175
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:18,390
and the algorithms and the
techniques come up with fine.

1176
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:20,130
Yeah, there you go. There you
go.

1177
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:24,060
Audrow Nash: Hmm. I wonder, I
wonder if there's difficulties

1178
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:28,080
there. Because of I assume,
well, I'm pretty sure you would

1179
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:34,170
have to do it in simulation. And
in simulation physics doesn't

1180
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:39,090
really match up perfectly with
our Oh, no, that. Yeah, yeah. So

1181
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:42,030
like, the attack is very hard to
simulate.

1182
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,370
Tobias Holmes: So you gotta you
got to get the you got to get

1183
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:47,010
the test stuff up, right, you
got to build something, you got

1184
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:51,060
to, you know, prototype it get a
texture rig up, see what you can

1185
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:54,630
learn, you know, in river river.
And I think I think most

1186
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:58,830
companies are all about that,
right? And every engineer would

1187
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:01,950
love doing that. Right? Oh, hey,
there's this new thing. We got

1188
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:05,640
to develop this new test rig
that that's saying, Yeah, let's

1189
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:10,200
figure out how it works. And
totally, we, you know, that's,

1190
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,450
that's part of the that's part
of the cool part of Blue River

1191
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:16,020
is that, you know, depending on
what project you're working on,

1192
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:20,010
there's still that goes on,
right? There's still that, hey,

1193
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:24,690
I got an idea. I don't know
where this is gonna go yet. But

1194
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:28,560
can I get a little bit of budget
to build a little something, and

1195
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,000
let's see what we get. Cool. And
if, and if you get down, we

1196
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,740
started to see promise. that'll
continue to get fans that will

1197
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:40,500
continue to get like, Okay,
we'll keep developing. Keep keep

1198
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,650
looking at that. Keep figuring
that out. Keep coming up with

1199
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:47,790
that. And I think I think all
companies at some point, you

1200
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:50,730
know, I think they do they have
to you have to do that. Right?

1201
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:53,190
If you want to, if you want to,
you know how to have a John

1202
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:58,110
Deere, you know, stick around as
long? Because we have to have

1203
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:06,210
somebody out there. Yay. Yeah, I
want to figure out how to do

1204
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:09,060
something that is totally no one
else is thinking about. Right.

1205
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:13,440
Yeah. Totally put a little bit
of investment in that. And, my

1206
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,370
God, what can come out with
we've come up with some cool

1207
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:22,050
stuff is, you know, just
scratching the surface. I think

1208
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:25,770
we got some of the right people,
you know, kind of like leading

1209
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:30,000
the direction there to continue
us to grow there. Yeah, I think

1210
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:34,020
I think yeah, I think that that,
and you talked a little bit

1211
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:41,160
earlier about, you know, the
kids and the growing of the

1212
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:44,640
population so that they are
capable of bringing those ideas

1213
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,060
seed.

1214
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,180
Audrow Nash: Yeah, actually,
that's that's kind of a good

1215
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:53,190
segue into what I would like to
ask you about, which is I mean,

1216
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:59,310
so you have kids, and you've
been encouraging them to program

1217
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,080
would you tell me a bit about
this?

1218
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:06,000
Unknown: Yes, so So I got I got
two daughters, my oldest, now

1219
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,390
she's a nurse. And so she was a
little bit behind the power

1220
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:13,230
curve when I, when I got into
engineering, but but but I did

1221
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:19,260
explain to her that, you know,
robotics, you know, computing

1222
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:23,700
and, you know, these actual
devices that she uses as a nurse

1223
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:27,510
are going to converge, right,
and that device will do a lot of

1224
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:31,260
things for you that you're doing
right now manually as a nurse,

1225
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:34,260
and so that she should pay
attention to it. Right. And so

1226
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:38,820
she, so she, you see has Riley
she's been, you know, keeping up

1227
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:44,040
with, you know, a little bit of
the technology, magazines, you

1228
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:49,140
know, around around the medical
field, and the new devices that

1229
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:52,170
are coming and even like, you
know, I talked to her about

1230
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:58,500
months ago, she was talking to a
doctor about these new these new

1231
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:03,180
What do you call them, you know,
so you can a doctor, they put

1232
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:07,020
that little thing on your your
finger in your policy and

1233
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:07,410
system.

1234
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,570
Tobias Holmes: Yeah, so she's
talking them about new ways that

1235
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:15,180
you don't even have to put that
thing on there, you know, you

1236
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:18,180
can just come in the room and in
the room has the environment,

1237
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,630
when the patient comes in, it
just gives you like kind of the

1238
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:25,080
patient's whole thing, right,
you can bring them in, and like

1239
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:28,350
3d Walk around them, like they
just kind of stand there, you

1240
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,870
can kind of walk around and
like, Okay, this is going on

1241
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:34,740
here, your heart rates here, it
looks like we got some

1242
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:39,660
distraction here on your phones.
And so technology is far away.

1243
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:43,260
But, but it's getting there,
right. And then this is where

1244
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:46,620
the future is going. And so our
doctors like, you know, paying

1245
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:50,190
attention to it, you know, and
likes her because she's like,

1246
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:53,790
interested in those things. My
youngest daughter is more of the

1247
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:58,050
the one that I you know, I have
more of impact on she is she's

1248
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:00,360
becoming a biomedical engineer
and actually go to school,

1249
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,840
University of Florida. And she
was about when she was about, I

1250
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:07,410
would say about 12. I had her
writing, writing small scripts

1251
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:10,860
and Python, I used to do some,
some robotics work out in

1252
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:15,420
University of Florida for Joel
teen, she used to come visit me.

1253
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:18,930
And we'd sit there and and one
of the cool things about it was

1254
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:21,630
that was Code Academy. For
Python, my daughter's super

1255
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:26,340
smart. And the way Code Academy
is set up. It's just it gives

1256
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:30,390
you a nice little introduction
into programming, and Python

1257
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:35,490
syntax. And so you can start to
slowly learn how to program and

1258
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:38,220
you can start to slowly
understand Python syntax, which

1259
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:41,790
isn't so complicated. It's not
like C++, you know, it's a

1260
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:45,810
little bit more, you know,
syntax see heavy Python, you

1261
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:48,210
just like, you know, you make
these senses, you make these

1262
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:51,600
things that is kind of make
sense, right? If this happens,

1263
01:17:51,630 --> 01:17:54,600
do this, that happens do that.
And there's not a whole lot of

1264
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,990
syntax around it just kind of in
which I learned that in school

1265
01:17:57,990 --> 01:18:02,130
anyway. And she was able to, you
know, to start developing, you

1266
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:04,860
know, smaller programs that
could do our homework and stuff

1267
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:08,880
for you. And, yeah, and so now
she's like, Yeah, Dad, I want

1268
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,120
to, I want to build robotic
arms. And I want to, you know,

1269
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:15,420
build like these kind of like
robotic prosthetics for people,

1270
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:18,720
right? Because she remembers
when I was in the military, she

1271
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:21,900
and I got a buddy of mine who,
who lost his arm in the

1272
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:26,640
military. And he's got a very,
you know, it works. But it's

1273
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,390
really primitive, like a fork
kind of fork finger arm thing.

1274
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:32,910
Yeah. And she wants to give them
hands, right? She wants to,

1275
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:35,970
like, you know, hey, I want to
be able to make and take the

1276
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:39,840
fork away and give him the
ability to grab things. Yeah.

1277
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:45,570
And but, you know, what did she
get that desire from the wanting

1278
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:50,310
to do that? And it was because
of the accessibility of

1279
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:56,040
programming. And, and things
like Python and Ross, write

1280
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:01,710
Python, being able to give you a
really high level language that

1281
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:05,220
isn't overly complicated to
start writing a program. It's

1282
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:08,970
very close to how you just kind
of think and write things down

1283
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:14,070
when you're writing stories and
things. And then Ross Ross gives

1284
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:17,250
you the ability to say okay,
hey, I got a I got this module

1285
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:20,160
that does this, I got the
camera, the camera takes in

1286
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:24,570
images. And I can get a process
image. I've got the sensor that

1287
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:28,410
tells me what the height is up
and down. And I can break that

1288
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:31,050
down into numbers. Essentially,
you break all of those things

1289
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:34,290
down into numbers. And if you
understand enough mathematics,

1290
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:38,550
you can now take camera images,
you can take sensors, you can

1291
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:42,420
take lasers, you can take all
these crazy things, you know

1292
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:46,440
that are you know, no one knows
how, how that how the camera

1293
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:51,000
works, like how does it take the
image? electronically? Yeah,

1294
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,920
exactly. That that's Oh my God,
how long it will take you to

1295
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,560
understand, you know, yeah, it's
like an undergraduate degree.

1296
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,010
Yeah, the sign What's behind
that, but but if you can tell me

1297
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:06,210
hey, I can give you the you
know, I can give you an array,

1298
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:10,710
you know, a vector of pixels and
what those pixel values are, and

1299
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:15,000
those correlate to colors. And
then you can decide to project

1300
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,660
that on to another screen that
just like displays numbers, you

1301
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:22,530
can almost see the face that
you're taking a picture of, even

1302
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:24,930
in ASCII, right, like we even
without it even would actually

1303
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:26,880
give you the color values, I can
give you an ASCII

1304
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,750
representation.

1305
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:31,770
Audrow Nash: Yeah, or just use
OpenCV, and then have it do face

1306
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:34,770
detection or some sort of thing,
some other existing library,

1307
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:39,360
You learn OpenCV, and then you
become your, you become a guru,

1308
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:46,050
right? Like you really get
OpenCV. You gotta learn the math

1309
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:49,260
behind it, right? So you got to
learn the math behind it. But

1310
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:52,590
you don't the tools, the tools
give you the accessibility is

1311
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:56,520
the cool part. You make it
accessible, you make it easy for

1312
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:00,270
these kids to get into it. And
so and so you get the the little

1313
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:04,140
touches, I think I talked to you
about this offline, was I had a

1314
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:09,630
kid, this this January, he was a
was Cristo Rey has a high school

1315
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:12,510
program where they bring you
know, other representative high

1316
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:16,770
school kids and merge them with
a mentor from a tech company, to

1317
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:19,500
one talk this kid how to how to
cut his camera on from a

1318
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,970
microphone, using Python, using
Code Academy, quickly learned

1319
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:26,880
how to do let you know simple
programs and modular

1320
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,330
programming, and bring in a
library, this is the library for

1321
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:33,510
your camera. It's just how you
cut your camera on. There's all

1322
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:36,780
these other API's in that
library that can like focus the

1323
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:41,040
camera and go look at different
things. But I'm just gonna, I'm

1324
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,250
just gonna show you how to cut
it on and off. Yeah, and hit

1325
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:46,980
record for you. And then I'm
going to show you this other

1326
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:51,120
library that takes your voice in
and you can teach it words, but

1327
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:54,990
you know, teach it that camera
teacher that on and it loads it

1328
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:57,690
from your voice, if I tell it
ain't gonna work, but from your

1329
01:21:57,690 --> 01:22:01,410
voice, it knows what cut means
and has a camera on and knows

1330
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:04,620
what that means. And it sends
the signal to the camera to turn

1331
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:08,520
on the camera API. And he's got
that working in the kids. It's

1332
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:14,160
like, Oh, yes. Like, he was so
upset about it, right? It's

1333
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:17,100
like, I love and see that. I
love to see that because that

1334
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:19,320
kid's gonna grow, you know, I
don't know he's gonna do in his

1335
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:22,860
life. I only mentored him for
for about four or five months.

1336
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:25,830
But I showed him wonderful
though, what is cake, what he's

1337
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:30,240
capable of doing? You know, and
it was over four or five months.

1338
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:33,240
That was just, I just scratched
the surface. And I always

1339
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,720
iterated. So this is just
scratching the surface, if you

1340
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:40,230
actually want to be able to do
this for real, and get paid,

1341
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:43,650
like I get paid to do it. You
need to go to school, you need

1342
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:46,200
to learn you need to actually
understand the math behind it,

1343
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,690
you need to understand the
details behind this so that you

1344
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:52,440
do it the most efficient way the
way we did it was a way they

1345
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:55,380
work, right. But this isn't the
most efficient, the most

1346
01:22:55,380 --> 01:23:00,120
effective way and ready for
sure. And if you really want to

1347
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:02,580
get a job doing that, you can't
go get a job making this right

1348
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:04,680
now because you're just a kid,
right? But if you get a

1349
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:07,410
credential that says I know how
to write software, well, I know

1350
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:09,780
how to develop cameras, and I
know how to develop, you know,

1351
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:15,120
sound devices. And now you can
go get a to this. Yeah, how cool

1352
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,030
is that? Right? How cool is it
to go get paid to make these

1353
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:20,760
kinds of devices into make these
things that affect the world.

1354
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:23,730
And he was totally, you know,
he's totally stoked about it.

1355
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:27,450
And that that, to me is the key.
That's the key to get our kids

1356
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:32,490
reback focused and, you know,
technology and doing smart

1357
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:36,900
things. And I'm kind of bias.
I'm a little older. I'm 43. And

1358
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:40,380
and I think like, you know,
there's a good chunk of our

1359
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:43,170
kids. I think every generation
has this, we just want to be

1360
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:46,650
like tick tock influences. And
they want to you know, they want

1361
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:49,560
to do things that I like, Yeah,
that's cool, when that's fun,

1362
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,280
but that isn't like, you know,
progressing society. Right?

1363
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:56,880
Yeah, some way but you really
need to be studying, you really

1364
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,610
need to be understanding, like
standing on the shoulders of the

1365
01:23:59,610 --> 01:24:02,400
guys that came before us, you
know, with this technology and

1366
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:06,990
growing it. And it's not easy.
You know, learning that calculus

1367
01:24:06,990 --> 01:24:09,180
and learning that, you know, the
physics...

1368
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:10,350
All the required skills.

1369
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:13,380
Tobias Holmes: That stuff is not
easy. So how do you motivate

1370
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:16,920
those kids to stick with it when
you know you got three

1371
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:22,560
dimensional calculus? You got
integrals, and why am I doing

1372
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:25,800
this? Yeah, I could go vo here
there was a tick tock dance.

1373
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:31,110
Making my money that way. It's
like Nah, you get to actually

1374
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:34,110
once you learn that stuff, and
what does that stuff apply to?

1375
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:36,900
That's another thing I think
schools fail at is I agree

1376
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:41,130
completely explaining to you why
is math important? Yeah, one

1377
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:44,400
plus one is soup. Okay, that's
great. That's good for a simple

1378
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:47,850
math. Why is it that I need to
know the integral of something

1379
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:51,870
what what usefulness is that?
Yeah, this may give them

1380
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:53,610
something that is actually
tangible.

1381
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:55,710
Audrow Nash: Totally. This is
why I think it's such an

1382
01:24:55,710 --> 01:25:00,420
important thing that you're
mentoring people. It's like It's

1383
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:03,870
hard to expect teachers to
understand, like K through 12

1384
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:08,460
teachers to understand the
reasons that engineers use, say

1385
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:12,510
sinusoids, or linear algebra or
whatever math related.

1386
01:25:12,510 --> 01:25:14,130
Unknown: Pythagorean theorem.
Yeah, for sure.

1387
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:18,390
Audrow Nash: All the programming
concepts. But so like you who,

1388
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:21,180
as someone who actually does,
it's very important for you to

1389
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:23,580
go hang out with kids, I think.
And me too. Like, this is

1390
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:27,060
something I hope to be able to
do in the near future, like, go

1391
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:30,240
help help help high school
students or something like this.

1392
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:35,310
As someone who's actually
applying these technologies, and

1393
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:38,700
be like, Oh, this is why
sinusoids relevant, or whatever,

1394
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:42,450
which is something my teachers
were not able to give me. When I

1395
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:43,140
was learning them.

1396
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:47,580
Unknown: You learn them, you get
the grade, you know? Yeah. I

1397
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:50,250
don't know how you got into
engineering, but it wasn't

1398
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:54,480
because you're learning sinusoid
like it wasn't your high school

1399
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,200
math teacher.

1400
01:25:55,230 --> 01:25:58,050
Audrow Nash: Not robotic for
sure. I got into electrical

1401
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:02,130
because my dad told me I should.
And then robotics was like, Oh,

1402
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:05,610
this is awesome. And so that's
how I got into robotics.

1403
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,100
Tobias Holmes: Robotics is
that's the cool thing about it

1404
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:11,820
is like, it's it's really world
world, it's kind of hard

1405
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:15,660
sometimes for computer science,
you know, to kind of explain,

1406
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:18,030
okay, yeah, you make this
website. But in order to make

1407
01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:21,360
this website, you got to know
all these, like data structures,

1408
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:25,500
and all this other stuff that is
not necessarily website base.

1409
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:28,950
And then in the, you know, the
backend stuff is a little bit

1410
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:32,310
more complicated, but you know,
being able to tie it to

1411
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:36,660
something that's real world, and
I think robotics, is a very cool

1412
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:39,960
thing, because there's just so
much, especially right now,

1413
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:43,500
there's so much room for things
that are not there. You know,

1414
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,780
when when kids are usually the
engineers, or the kids who are

1415
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:48,990
like, I wish this could work
like this, we got this thing

1416
01:26:48,990 --> 01:26:51,960
already. But why couldn't they
work like this? Like who, you

1417
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:54,600
know, I'm not the guy who made
it, but why did they make it

1418
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,240
like that I would have made it
this way, I would have been

1419
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,610
something like this, I don't
know how to do it. But if I

1420
01:26:59,610 --> 01:27:02,520
could, I would have made it this
way, I would have made my

1421
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:06,150
camera, you know, fly around on
a drone and follow me around the

1422
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:08,460
house, right? Like, and then I
don't have to just sit in my

1423
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:12,060
chair, and have this video, I
could just go for a walk. And we

1424
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,910
could have this video, right?
That'd be super cool. You know,

1425
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:18,450
and we got it, we have that
technology now. Alright, but if

1426
01:27:18,450 --> 01:27:21,630
no one ever developed that and
thought of that up, that

1427
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:25,410
wouldn't have happened. And, and
we got to give those kids the,

1428
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:30,420
you know, I think early on the
early on is a photogram. Because

1429
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:35,220
the technology is accessible.
Now, it's, it's not as

1430
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:39,030
complicated. It's not like our
grandfathers and our fathers,

1431
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:43,500
you know, entry level to get in.
It is now at a level where I can

1432
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,500
teach my seven year old
daughter, you know, hey, this is

1433
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:51,240
how you program a little math
equation in Python. Yes, how you

1434
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:54,570
take variables. And this is how
you make these variables do this

1435
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:56,580
map. And this is how you get a
result out.

1436
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:59,130
Audrow Nash: Or even this is how
you talk to your camera. This is

1437
01:27:59,130 --> 01:28:01,950
how you run an optimization.
This is how you do these things.

1438
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:05,340
Because these libraries exist.
So it's a lot of infrastructure

1439
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:07,440
that you would have had to build
yourself.

1440
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:11,340
Tobias Holmes: Oh my god,
optimization optimization. I

1441
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:17,100
just learned about that like
grad school. Optimize this

1442
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:20,190
thing? What does that for? When
you want to optimize? You know,

1443
01:28:20,190 --> 01:28:22,860
all of your resources in the
best way? So you're not wasting?

1444
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:27,330
Yeah, if you don't, you know,
it's a very complex mathematical

1445
01:28:27,330 --> 01:28:32,370
thing. Yeah. But it's a very
intuitive concept. It's a very

1446
01:28:32,370 --> 01:28:35,910
intuitive concept. Because you
can totally teach a kid how to

1447
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:39,570
use a library, this will
optimize your output. And that's

1448
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:44,700
what you want to use. That is
what's going on totally right.

1449
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:47,340
It's totally right. And then
they like, oh, I actually want

1450
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:50,640
to I actually want to know what
optimization is. There's a class

1451
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:53,130
for that. You could actually go
learn the math, right, you can

1452
01:28:53,190 --> 01:28:56,220
actually go learn to improve
optimization algorithms, because

1453
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:59,310
there's, there's not just one,
there's multiple different ones

1454
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:00,750
for different situations.

1455
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:05,400
Audrow Nash: Yep. Yeah, concave.
It's like not, and ones that are

1456
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:06,840
not concave. All these things.

1457
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:09,270
Unknown: All these, and you
constantly gonna need to use

1458
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:12,060
that, you know, going forward,
especially with robotics,

1459
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:14,310
especially with all of these
different, you know, new

1460
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:16,980
technologies that we're
developing with AI, all that

1461
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:19,140
stuff. If you really want to get
in you want to make your own

1462
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:22,200
robot that thinks for itself,
you know, Hey, these are the

1463
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:26,730
ways to go. And every kid isn't
gonna want to do that. But I

1464
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:30,060
think it's going to bring a lot
of kids, I think it will bring a

1465
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:31,710
lot of kids you know,

1466
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:37,080
Audrow Nash: Let's see. Wrapping
up because we are running out of

1467
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:42,270
time. I would love to hear
advice that you would have for

1468
01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:46,680
someone say like teenager
someone just about to go to

1469
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:52,680
college who might be interested
in robotics. Any any advice for

1470
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:52,980
them?

1471
01:29:54,180 --> 01:30:00,900
Unknown: Um, high school or a
brand new college grad. You're

1472
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:05,400
definitely doing the right
thing, this is the way to go. I

1473
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,890
would say that, you know, the
most, you know, one of the most

1474
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:12,240
important things about college
is determining what you're going

1475
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,000
to do for your future, like,
what are you going to do, you

1476
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,110
know, a good majority of the
rest of your life. And robotics

1477
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:24,000
is the future, it is the way
that, you know, society is

1478
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,480
going, you know, for better or
for worse, for the next, you

1479
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:34,500
know, 50 to 100 years, you know,
you can go get a job, you know,

1480
01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:38,370
developing, you know, something
that is, I don't know, you can

1481
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:43,470
go be a firefighter, or, or a
gas station mechanic, you can go

1482
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:47,550
do something that is, you know,
not necessarily, you know,

1483
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:51,720
cutting edge, or there's,
there's some work to be done in

1484
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:55,800
it, you know, I don't want to
down up into crease. But there's

1485
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:59,550
some people that you know, that
graduated college with degrees,

1486
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:05,370
and are working at like CVS, or
someplace that is like, you

1487
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:08,400
know, you went to college for
four years or more, and you're,

1488
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:11,370
you're not even working in the
area that you want to go study

1489
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:14,520
in. If you got to study
robotics, you're going to have a

1490
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:19,410
job for the next for the rest of
your life. Kids nowadays, they

1491
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:23,190
ain't going to school for to
learn software, mechanics,

1492
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:28,620
robotics integration. There is
no end. There is no...

1493
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:31,800
Audrow Nash: You mean that
there's lots of opportunity, no

1494
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:32,730
end of opportunities.

1495
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:35,790
Unknown: No end of
opportunities, right. And then

1496
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:40,710
the the areas to go specialize
in, or just, you know, even more

1497
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:44,040
broader, you know, what is it
about robotics that you are

1498
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:48,030
interested in? You know, I would
like for us to develop a

1499
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:50,850
robotics degree. And I think
some universities do have that.

1500
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:55,020
It's probably not very well
defined. And they probably are

1501
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:58,410
retired universities have well
defined one. But no, because

1502
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:02,670
it's a lot of things, right?
It's program. Yep. It's a little

1503
01:32:02,670 --> 01:32:05,400
bit of electrical, it's a little
bit of mechanical, right. So

1504
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,070
it's a little bit of the three
main disciplines, right, that we

1505
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:12,150
think about electrical software,
mechanical, right, it's those

1506
01:32:12,150 --> 01:32:18,840
three things combined, to do
something real world. And so

1507
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:22,620
there's the integration part.
And so if there's a, I would

1508
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:25,350
say, a good defined robotics
program would have those three

1509
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:29,100
things as classes, read a little
code, understand the basics of

1510
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:33,240
circuits, understand how
mechanical devices work, and

1511
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:35,730
then understand how to pull
these things together to dues

1512
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:39,630
will work in the world. And then
allow the students to go and,

1513
01:32:40,410 --> 01:32:43,860
you know, and sensors, right,
bring it in sensors, utilizing

1514
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:47,730
sensors, and then allow a
student to go, what are you?

1515
01:32:47,850 --> 01:32:50,370
What are you most interested in?
You know, what did you like the

1516
01:32:50,370 --> 01:32:53,790
most? What do you want sensors,
more, you want to write code,

1517
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,940
you want to build robots, you
want to, you know, you want to

1518
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:59,580
build the circuitry that powers
up the motors that powers up

1519
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:03,510
the, you know, the devices, and,
you know, right solar solar

1520
01:33:03,510 --> 01:33:06,090
devices that that, you know,
bring the energy and that way,

1521
01:33:06,510 --> 01:33:11,220
you know, all sorts of things.
Yeah, the dried out, Oh, my God,

1522
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:17,010
the areas of, of words are where
they're going to go to dive in

1523
01:33:17,010 --> 01:33:23,070
deep. They're endless. And so
it's the way to go, I would I

1524
01:33:23,070 --> 01:33:27,750
would even say, go develop, go
get a traditional degree,

1525
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:30,810
undergrad, right, but get a
traditional, if you already know

1526
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:33,690
if I know I want to write
program, or I know I want to

1527
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:36,510
write circuits. Or I know I want
to, you know, I'm more

1528
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:40,320
mechanically inclined, and I
want to do mechanics, do that.

1529
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:43,830
But absolutely get your master's
in robotics, take that

1530
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:47,790
knowledge, and then go into
robotics after that. Okay,

1531
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:50,400
because that knowledge is going
to then that knowledge is then

1532
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:54,660
going to allow you to build a
better robot. Right? I can, I

1533
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:57,480
could probably as an undergrad,
undergrad is usually too broad,

1534
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:01,050
you don't ever get enough. And
if you if you go too broad

1535
01:34:01,050 --> 01:34:03,960
across all those disciplines,
you will never know enough. But

1536
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:07,500
if you're a mechanical, you got
a bachelor's in mechanical. And

1537
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:10,140
then I show you robotics, you
now know how to apply your

1538
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:13,530
mechanics to this robot
situation or you know how to

1539
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:14,790
apply your software.

1540
01:34:15,210 --> 01:34:17,340
Audrow Nash: For the control
theory, or things you you learn

1541
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:17,970
as a mechanical.

1542
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:22,020
Unknown: There you go. So you
get the foundation, and then

1543
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:24,960
apply that foundation to robots
and things. So think about what

1544
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:28,860
robot and what about robot so we
should be introducing our kids

1545
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:32,850
in high school to robots. It
should be as fundamental as

1546
01:34:32,850 --> 01:34:36,630
like, you know, they had those
old schools that were like,

1547
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:43,770
where you had like ROTC and you
had Homeric and you had shop

1548
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:46,950
class, you know where they show
the kids how to do so all the

1549
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:51,300
stuff we should have a shop
robots class, all go in, all

1550
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:56,190
kids get in it. You got to pass
it right like you got it. You

1551
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:58,770
got to pay attention here
because this is gonna be part of

1552
01:34:58,770 --> 01:35:02,550
your life whether you like it
Not, but those kids who are

1553
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:06,540
really into it, hey, what part
of it do you really like,

1554
01:35:06,630 --> 01:35:09,870
because this is where mechanical
engineers, they build it. This

1555
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:13,500
is where the electrical is guys,
they do the circuits. This is

1556
01:35:13,530 --> 01:35:18,420
the control guys, they develop,
you know how it knows when they

1557
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:21,150
go up or when they go down on
when to go this way or when they

1558
01:35:21,150 --> 01:35:25,140
go that way. This is computer
vision guys who really get into,

1559
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:28,590
you know, open CV in a write
codes, you got to know how to

1560
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:32,220
write software, in order to to
be able to utilize the camera

1561
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:35,850
and utilize the sensors. So you
so you got to be a software

1562
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:38,550
engineer. And so now those kids
know what they want to do. They

1563
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:40,560
get out of high school, they
know what they want to go do.

1564
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:44,220
Yeah. And if you don't want to
be a robot guy, then yeah, go

1565
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:49,590
could be a banker or finance.
With those guys, we need those

1566
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:53,820
guys suit. But that's really the
kids that are like us. I believe

1567
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:58,440
we're all nerds. We're all those
kids who are like breaking apart

1568
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:01,650
something that your mom had when
she was a kid. When you were a

1569
01:36:01,650 --> 01:36:05,760
kid, you have your mom's like
radio or something like that.

1570
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:10,560
And you're like, oh, yeah,
that's that's us. Right? That's

1571
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:15,690
our, our type of kids. And I
wish I wish I had a high school

1572
01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:19,860
teacher that showed showing
robotics when I was that age,

1573
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:23,400
because in that age, I'm even
more I was even more fired up

1574
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:26,940
about school and stuff then than
I am now. And I'm still fired up

1575
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:31,140
about it. But man had I know,
then I would have already picked

1576
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:35,640
my stuff. Like I went to the
military. I did a very long

1577
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,370
around the way path...

1578
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,790
Audrow Nash: To come to where
you are now working on the

1579
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:42,480
future.

1580
01:36:42,510 --> 01:36:45,750
Unknown: Yeah, I would have
loved to have just been right

1581
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:48,780
bing bing right on it. Because
this is this is it, man, this is

1582
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:52,920
my passion. You know, creating
things in the world and

1583
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,560
understanding how technology
works, and then being able to

1584
01:36:55,740 --> 01:36:59,160
leverage the technology to
create a new thing. That's

1585
01:36:59,190 --> 01:37:02,430
that's me. I think that's a lot
of I think that's just every

1586
01:37:02,430 --> 01:37:07,620
engineer. I think most of us,
you have to be like passionate

1587
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:11,940
in order to get the capital. She
can't get through this though.

1588
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:18,720
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. All right.
So now finally wrapping up Is

1589
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:25,260
there any like websites, blogs,
like your company blog, or your

1590
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:28,650
any any contact info you'd like
to share with our listeners?

1591
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:33,000
Unknown: So there's two things,
I don't have the websites of

1592
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,580
topical head. But there's two
things...

1593
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:38,910
Audrow Nash: I can include them
in the post. So Blue River one.

1594
01:37:39,330 --> 01:37:43,860
Tobias Holmes: So along the
lines of, of young kids getting

1595
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:48,690
into technology, Crystal Ray
program, it's a high school

1596
01:37:48,690 --> 01:37:53,610
program, that, uh, that, you
know, I would, I would advertise

1597
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:56,730
it to parents who have young
children who haven't went to

1598
01:37:56,730 --> 01:37:59,910
high school yet, who want to
give their kids a little bit of

1599
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:01,950
an edge when it comes to high
school other than just going to

1600
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:04,950
the top High School in the area,
which that's there too. But if

1601
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:07,020
your kid doesn't have the
opportunity to get there to the

1602
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:11,520
top High School in the area,
Cristo, Rey is particularly

1603
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:14,730
structured towards kids who are
not going to get into the top

1604
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:19,440
high schools in Cupertino for
the opportunity to work with

1605
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:23,400
professionals in the robotics
field, or any professional

1606
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:23,730
field.

1607
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:26,610
Audrow Nash: Is it a common
model that other high schools

1608
01:38:26,610 --> 01:38:29,460
follow? I imagine listeners will
be all over not just in the Bay

1609
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:30,210
Area, too.

1610
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:31,770
Unknown: I'm not sure I'm not
even sure.

1611
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:35,040
Audrow Nash: I heard about FIRST
Robotics is really good to get

1612
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,170
high school students or maybe
even younger.

1613
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:40,320
Unknown: So that was my second
one. That was actually my second

1614
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:46,620
one. So I got a I got a we got
like, five or six first robotic

1615
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:50,130
engineers, I got one of the guys
who's in FIRST Robotics on our

1616
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:54,570
team, who is a He's like one of
the he's not only went through

1617
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:58,020
from you know, from grade school
to high school and graduated and

1618
01:38:58,020 --> 01:39:01,830
went on he's like, a, an
administrator now in FIRST

1619
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:06,630
Robotics. So he's, he's like,
he's a very like pivotal FIRST

1620
01:39:06,630 --> 01:39:10,170
Robotics person, and just the
whole organization. And we

1621
01:39:10,170 --> 01:39:14,460
probably got through his through
him. Another five people that

1622
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:18,060
are from first robotics. And
these guys Oh, cool. These guys

1623
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:24,150
are amazing. They're amazing.
Audrow Like, I can't even I

1624
01:39:24,150 --> 01:39:27,540
can't even put it into words,
man, these guys. They're young,

1625
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:32,790
and they're on it. And so I
would say, first, robotics is

1626
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:38,820
absolutely a a thing. A good
thing to get your kids involved

1627
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:42,450
in. If you have it, right like
that. To me, those are the

1628
01:39:42,450 --> 01:39:45,450
things that I wish I had in high
school. I wish I had a high

1629
01:39:45,450 --> 01:39:48,630
school focus towards
professional development. And I

1630
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:51,870
would I wish I had a high school
that that had the first robotics

1631
01:39:51,870 --> 01:39:54,660
program I would have told you
partake of it, and I wouldn't

1632
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:58,350
kicked ass and because I because
it's you get because I get the

1633
01:39:58,350 --> 01:40:02,520
kids who are interested in that
Get the kids who like, I want to

1634
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:06,300
do this, I want to make robots.
I think one of our guys, one or

1635
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:12,210
two of our guys is in the battle
bots competition this year, they

1636
01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:15,390
just had they just filmed and so
they're in the battle bots

1637
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:19,650
competition. A couple of our
guys were are there not even

1638
01:40:19,650 --> 01:40:22,980
full time employees out there
interning, working for NASA

1639
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:26,280
helping them nasa develop some
of their software stuff in

1640
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:32,730
robotic stuff. And, and just
this a great group of having

1641
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:37,200
that great foundation, you know,
the right things. And it's very

1642
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:40,590
targeted to robotics, which is a
tough thing to go find, like,

1643
01:40:40,590 --> 01:40:45,030
you know, a hiring manager and
robotics is you can find a

1644
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:48,120
software engineer, I can find a
mechanical engineer, I can find,

1645
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:52,080
I can find the individuals, I
need someone who understands how

1646
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:54,960
we do this in the robotics
environment, the parts and how

1647
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:58,020
they really is. And that is that
is a little bit more

1648
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:00,900
challenging. When you get these
guys like this that have been

1649
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:03,510
particularly focused on a
robotics environment that is so

1650
01:41:03,510 --> 01:41:07,080
much better. It's so it's so
great, because they already get

1651
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:10,470
it. It's a real time system. It
has to work in all kinds of

1652
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:14,250
environments, lots of variables.
Oh my god, that is the greatest.

1653
01:41:14,790 --> 01:41:18,300
So first, robotics is my second
one. So those are two things

1654
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:22,350
that I that I think, I think
that I would point people to go

1655
01:41:22,350 --> 01:41:25,980
get more involved in crystal re
FIRST Robotics. There's another

1656
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:27,990
one, but I can't think of the
name of the song won't bring it

1657
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:33,000
up. But um, yeah, if I, if I
could start all over again, or

1658
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,330
if I could, my kids are both a
high school now. But if they

1659
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:37,890
could redo it.

1660
01:41:39,090 --> 01:41:41,370
Audrow Nash: They'd be doing
that. Doing that man,

1661
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:44,430
Tobias Holmes: they'd be doing
that. That's not waste. It's not

1662
01:41:44,430 --> 01:41:48,030
waste our kids signs that the
future is going to be

1663
01:41:48,030 --> 01:41:52,890
ridiculously competitive. And so
that the better the Headstart

1664
01:41:52,890 --> 01:41:56,220
that we can give them the
better. And so crystal Ray gets

1665
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:59,160
you in a professional mind High
School, at the high school

1666
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:01,500
level, we should start thinking
about, you know, even some

1667
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:05,700
people will say even before, I
feel like great school, I feel

1668
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:08,190
like great schools, you should
give them some chocolate, right.

1669
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:14,100
So serious, but high school is
sounding good, serious. Oh,

1670
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:19,650
yeah. And from there, let's go.
Let's CCS kids. You know, let's

1671
01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:22,590
keep us competitive. You know,
and that's, and that's no

1672
01:42:22,590 --> 01:42:27,180
robotics, because, yeah, that
that that is the future man. The

1673
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:30,810
other things, you know, you
know, outside of robotics areas,

1674
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:35,130
they're going to still be there.
But they're, you know, they're

1675
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:40,080
going to be using robotics to
man, the bankers and, and the,

1676
01:42:40,290 --> 01:42:43,710
you know, what else? What else?
Is there? The retailers, they're

1677
01:42:43,710 --> 01:42:45,300
going to be using robotics.

1678
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,420
Audrow Nash: Yeah. All right.
Thank you.

1679
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:53,730
Tobias Holmes: All right, man.
So, I hope you enjoy the

1680
01:42:53,730 --> 01:42:59,190
conversation. And I appreciate
talking with you, man. It was

1681
01:42:59,190 --> 01:43:02,310
great, great pleasure about talk
about you know, Blue River

1682
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:06,060
robotics and, and what we do
here, man, you know, the

1683
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:09,150
future's bright. So, you know,
let's continue to contribute to

1684
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:10,170
that. That's for sure.

1685
01:43:14,790 --> 01:43:17,010
Audrow Nash: Thanks for
listening to this conversation

1686
01:43:17,010 --> 01:43:20,760
with Tobias Holmes. Thank you
again to our founding sponsor,

1687
01:43:20,790 --> 01:43:23,490
Open Robotics, and I hope to see
you next time
