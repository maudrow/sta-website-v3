00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,130
Audrow Nash: This is a
conversation with Maria

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,690
Telleria, who is a co founder
and the CTO of Canvas. Canvas

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,410
makes a drywall finishing robot
for construction sites. One

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,980
thing that I think is especially
interesting about Canvas is that

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,790
they are working closely with a
trade union. In case you don't

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,560
know, quoting from the AFSCME,
a large trade union in the

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,730
US. A union is an organization
formed by workers who joined

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,850
together and use their strength
to have a voice in their

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,070
workplace. Unions help workers
negotiate for better wages,

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,850
benefits and job safety, among
other things. I'm not very

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,090
knowledgeable about unions. But
my impression before this

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,050
interview, was that unions often
slow the adoption of new

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,370
technology in a trade. And I
think most robotics companies

14
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,900
I've talked to avoid or try to
automate unions out of

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,490
relevance. So I was surprised to
hear how Canvas is working

16
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,360
closely with a trade union, and
that both canvas and the trade

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,200
union seem to be benefiting from
the collaboration. In the

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,800
future, I expect to see more
robotics companies following

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,880
Canvas's lead. Since I think
working with unions can help

20
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,450
robotics companies understand
their problem, get into

21
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,200
industries much faster, and
avoid resistance from people

22
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,780
already in the trade. At the
same time, I believe unions can

23
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,380
benefit from automation in
canvases case, their drywall

24
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,100
robot helps to reduce the rate
of repetitive injuries that end

25
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,370
people's careers. And they help
a trade that is significantly

26
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,240
short on people to meet their
demand. I'm Audrow Nash. This

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,870
is the Sense Think Act Podcast. Thank
you to our founding sponsor,

28
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:58,380
open robotics. And now here's my
conversation with Maria. Hi,

29
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,120
Maria, would you introduce
yourself?

30
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,200
Maria Telleria: Yeah, Maria
Telleria. Yeah, I am co founder

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,520
and CTO of Canvas. And we're a
robotics company bringing

32
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,670
drywall finishing robots to the
construction industry.

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
Audrow Nash: Now, tell me about
your drywall finishing robot.

34
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,700
Maria Telleria: Yeah, so when
we, you know, we come from a

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,150
research background, and we've
been always looking at why are

36
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,750
robots used? In other words,
they are used, but not really

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,780
widely use outside of
manufacturing and logistics. And

38
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,090
read I think is a challenge that
probably many in the audience

39
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,820
know that construction
environments are much more

40
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,510
difficult for robotics. And so
my co founder, Kevin, Albert,

41
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,450
and myself, were always driven
by like, hey, let's bring robots

42
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,450
to another place. We got
fascinated by construction,

43
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,010
right, the size of the market is
huge, the problem, but then, you

44
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,560
know, you kind of keep digging
and digging. And that's where we

45
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,010
found drywall finishing. And we
pick this test, because it is

46
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,610
particularly painful in terms of
like a lot of wear and tear on

47
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,080
the body. A lot of like
repetitive steps, you know, long

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,630
schedule, even if the work is
not consistently being done,

49
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,510
because you have drying steps.
So really, the goal was like,

50
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,720
Okay, this seems to have all the
adult dirty dangerous for

51
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,280
robotics. Let's go at it. And so
yeah, robot is, I keep saying

52
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,090
tool because it is really meant
to be an augmentation of the

53
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,050
worker. So we do have a worker
in the loop, they are a key part

54
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,110
of the component. They're a key
part of how we actually solve

55
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,080
this problem, the unstructured
environment. But it is, you

56
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,650
know, this robotic system, it's
a robotic arm with very

57
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,590
specialized and the factors that
allowed it to spray on the joint

58
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,590
compound, which is where you
apply on the drywall sheets to

59
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,730
cover kind of the seams, and
then a sanding and detector that

60
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,390
sends it down so that it looks
smooth. And that robot arm is on

61
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,940
a mobile base that allows the
right to reach all the different

62
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,740
places in the construction site.

63
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,560
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So what
does it look like when the robot

64
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,260
is actually doing its spraying
and sanding? You kind of just

65
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,130
position it near a wall and it
goes in slowly covers everything

66
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,600
with its arm? Or how does it
look?

67
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,800
Maria Telleria: Yeah, I mean,
maybe this is where a picture's

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,300
worth 1000 words. So pull up the
video to share it you.

69
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,180
screen here, you know this is
pretty much a quick peek. But

70
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,240
I'll describe it as we go right
now really, you know, starting

71
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,340
with the idea that there is a
lot of construction going on.

72
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,030
This is what the job site looks
like when we come in. It has

73
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,210
been taped. So you have to apply
the state between the jump the

74
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,970
different drywall sheets that
you come in, and you go ahead

75
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,960
and install that spray and the
factor that you see there. A big

76
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,270
part here. I'll pause it to talk
a little bit about it. Because

77
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,300
you mentioned like, right you
position it, like keep our

78
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,690
promises we have to build our
map to make this happen, right.

79
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,470
We don't have a map when we
start you know there is things

80
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,890
like bid models. So the models
the building information model.

81
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,520
It's kind of like the had
construction sites, right? They

82
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,890
do exist, they're pretty
detailed, they have everything

83
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,220
done that. Rarely, by the time
we come in are those that

84
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,100
accurate because nobody's
updated when like, things had to

85
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,680
move a little bit, you cannot
make that decision as long as

86
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,230
not something structural people
can move a wall a little bit

87
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,710
because of whatever recent
happened on site. So one is not

88
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,620
accurate in two, they don't
often get shared all the way

89
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,190
down the chain of people who are
working right there kind of more

90
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,430
useable design and modeling
stage rather than in the build

91
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,670
stage. So most of our customers
just have a floorplan, so 2d

92
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,270
plan, and they say, right, I
gotta finish these walls. So one

93
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,940
of the key things that we
implemented was said, we can't

94
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,180
depend on them having a male
have been mobile, excuse me, and

95
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,820
we can't depend on the BIM model
being accurate. So we're going

96
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,940
to have to map ourselves. So
basically, the robot comes in

97
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,530
recruit scans to space
identifies the different areas

98
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,040
that it has to treat. And then a
key part here is that it splits

99
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,800
them up into workspaces, right,
this goes along with the fact

100
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
that the robot arm can only
reach so much right just like

101
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,080
your arm, you at some point, you
have to use your legs to move

102
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,140
along. So by splitting up into
these workspaces, we really

103
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,860
think of the mobile base that
you see this pretty big base

104
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,970
position said roughly to this
spot, and then the robot arm can

105
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,450
use all of its precision to go
ahead and target it in a blank

106
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,750
here, you see our operator
select the workspace is the

107
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,540
rows, columns that he wants to
do. And then you see how it

108
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,130
sprays the material work life is
very consistent code across and

109
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,430
making sure that we target the
low spots and and then by the

110
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,310
end of it, right, you have a
full coverage of your machine.

111
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,330
This part we can touch on later.
But one of the hardest parts

112
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,410
with construction is reporting
back on what's happening, right,

113
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,280
a lot of the problem is when
work is done manually, you have

114
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,950
to kind of call people up and
get kind of an update on what

115
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,730
happened. And really report them
back. I think that's one of the

116
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,060
secondary effects of robotics
and logistics and automate in

117
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,970
manufacturing is that you also
get that data for free. So we're

118
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,390
just showing a little bit of
what's possible here. When the

119
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,180
robots in the loop, you know,
the supervisor can get updates

120
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,280
that are live and they're very
accurate. And then the next day,

121
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,360
same robot arm mobile base,
different end effector. So we

122
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,140
put the sanding header comes in,
it uses the same map that we

123
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,110
created the day before, and it
starts standing away. And this

124
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,230
is, you know, again, a lot of
our development has gone around

125
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,380
the sanding, because it is a
very soft material, right? If

126
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,260
you reach out across the wall,
you could scratch it with your

127
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,990
nail, it's so soft material that
you need to make it look really

128
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,570
flat. So you have all of these
things that you have to work

129
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,050
around to make sure that you get
the night consistent finish. And

130
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,930
this is again, talking back to
the data reporting that you can

131
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,980
get back. This video is a
little, I think, from 2020. So

132
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,920
this has 25 projects completed,
but we're now in the more like

133
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,380
40 plus range. Oh, that's so
exciting. And doing.

134
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,470
Audrow Nash: Awesome. The video
was very informative. Oh, yeah.

135
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:05,760
Okay. So let's see, what what
exactly does the Operator do?

136
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,530
Maria Telleria: Yeah, so I think
the operator really does all the

137
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,180
things around it that allow the
robot to be successful in a

138
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,180
structured and dynamic
environment, right. So they do

139
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,180
things like selecting which
areas you want to skip, right,

140
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,460
there might be a reason that you
don't finish that right then and

141
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,370
there. They can provide feedback
to the machine as well on the

142
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,730
quality so that the machine can
tune in and get that feedback

143
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,090
process from it. You're also
doing a lot around coordinating

144
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,910
around with other trades, right?
So the reality is the

145
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,640
electrician is also in there,
you know, the floor guys coming

146
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,100
in the painters right behind
you. So that coordination with

147
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,880
all the different people, but in
reality, we they really are the

148
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,400
ones that at the end of the day,
they're the quality assurance,

149
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,130
right? They make sure your
feedback or even sometimes a

150
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,130
little bit of manual work to
ensure that the final bullet so

151
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,010
that the machine really takes
the 90% plus of the brunt of the

152
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,310
work. But they're the ones who
are skilled who have this. So

153
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,030
our operators are tapers,
they're journeyman takers who

154
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,670
have been trained and the
skilled and so they can pick up

155
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,550
a tool if they need to, like a
manual tool and fix up anything.

156
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,310
But more importantly, they have
that eye in that training to

157
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,460
say, Okay, this needs a little
bit more here. A little bit less

158
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,860
there. Okay, that's how you get
a wall to look.

159
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,010
Audrow Nash: Yeah, so you said
they're called tapers. So that's

160
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,090
the construction role, like job
role for someone who would do

161
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:29,220
this. It's really interesting to
me that you are having the

162
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,520
person who would do this
normally be the robot operator.

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,440
Can you tell me a bit more about
that?

164
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,619
Maria Telleria: Sure. Yeah. And
I like spend a little bit on the

165
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,459
call papers because you string
this paper tape across it so

166
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,009
right that's where the name
comes from. There you know it's

167
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:47,699
more like drywall finishers.
It's kind of the more formal

168
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:49,799
term but everybody in the
construction side be like oh the

169
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,839
tape you know, construction they
ended up getting to that to the

170
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,099
point do you string tape your
tape? Up to your point the plug

171
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,229
why? Right because we can have
gone a lot of different ways.

172
00:10:01,229 --> 00:10:04,559
But as we really thought about
it, again, to ensure that we get

173
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,159
that quality finish, we needed
that expertise that skill level,

174
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:11,159
there's going to be things that
may never make sense for the

175
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,649
robot to automate, right?
Imagine somebody decided to make

176
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:16,949
like a gothic column out of
drywall, you could do it, I

177
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,379
don't think I'd want to spend
the time programming it because

178
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:22,499
you'll never see it again,
right? But a worker has the

179
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:26,279
years of experience that
delicate touch that adaptability

180
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,249
that a robot doesn't do. And
it's okay, I'm going to start

181
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:32,279
the robot here, finish the brunt
of my work. And I'm going to use

182
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,039
my skills where it's really
needed, right to provide that

183
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,969
feedback or to finish some
delicate part of it. And for us,

184
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:41,429
really to be successful there.
You needed somebody who could

185
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:44,159
work with a robot, right? So
it's like, oh, we have this

186
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,609
great, skilled, talented person,
we augment them. That's the way

187
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:50,669
to go. Right? As opposed to
maybe bringing in somebody who's

188
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:53,969
like a robotics expert. Okay,
maybe the robot kept running,

189
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:55,259
but not sure that well, we?

190
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,650
Audrow Nash: Yeah, for sure.
Okay, that's so interesting. And

191
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,200
so what are some of the
challenges? So if you brought in

192
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,140
a robotics person, the robotic
person may not know anything

193
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,630
about the wall, but can keep the
robot running, as you're saying.

194
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,580
But so if you work with a taper,
then, like, what would have been

195
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,040
some of the challenges of
working with the taper kind of

196
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,830
bringing the robot to the craft
instead of the craft to the

197
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,240
robot? is what it seems?

198
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,730
Maria Telleria: Yeah, yeah,
that's a really good way to put

199
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,020
it, it really is making it super
easy to use, right. And so

200
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,900
because we want their time that
they have, right, where the

201
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,900
robots running autonomous to be
doing other things, like we

202
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,990
said, coordinating, tackling
tough spots. So it's really

203
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,080
about like, making like a tool,
right, they learn it, they do

204
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,170
come to a training and Canvas,
but after that, they should just

205
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,930
keep on running. Right? They
it's sort of be asking them

206
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,810
things in a robotics manner,
right? Like, would you like to

207
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,270
increase your workspace? Right?
That might be a little bit or

208
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:55,800
like, Hey, your inverse
kinematics failed to solve like

209
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,710
that, that would have mean
something to them, but something

210
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,550
like, Hey, what's the body look
like to you? Right? And that's

211
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,100
more your, I guess, specific
example, for example, we

212
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,160
wouldn't be like, is the
thickness, you know, 1.2

213
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,700
millimeters as specified? They
don't, that's not what it works.

214
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,740
But we could say like, Hey, do
you think this needs more

215
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,010
material added? Right? Yeah. Are
there most faults? Are they have

216
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,400
spots, that's language that they
know, that then we can translate

217
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,340
into? Okay, they said there was
low spots, we gotta build up

218
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,300
more material here, you know, go
from 1.2 millimeters to 1.4. So

219
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,590
I think it's a lot about think
about translating things to the,

220
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,190
you know, the words around them
that the craft words, if you

221
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,250
will that make sense. And then
really making sure that your

222
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,370
robot is a tool, right? Not
something that has to require

223
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,120
programming. We also haven't
really kind of on site support

224
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,540
within the user interface. So
when they do run into these

225
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,120
problems, which they might,
there's somebody just on the

226
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,240
other end, to keep them running
and to do that kind of debugging

227
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,070
that you'd expect a roboticist
to do.

228
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,360
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So what
does the whole step setup look

229
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,740
like in terms of even the
infrastructure behind the robot?

230
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,010
Like, I guess it gets to the
business model? Is it like you

231
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,190
lease the robot to a company and
then you surprise the service?

232
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,360
Or how does it work?

233
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,500
Maria Telleria: Yeah, we are
doing a leasing model for the

234
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,440
customer. So they come to get
trained, they trained their

235
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,800
operators, and then they lose
the machine, you know, for year

236
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,040
long leases. And then they have
different projects that they

237
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,800
would move in, we help them with
the logistics of moving the

238
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,470
machine since it's something
new, but from the other part,

239
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,640
right, they pay per day, and
then they have access to all the

240
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,090
support around so they have
remote support that they can

241
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,180
call that's usually the what
they would normally use. But if

242
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,940
you know something really big
happened on site, there's also

243
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:50,220
people from campus who can go
and support them on site. And it

244
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,280
was a problem if needed. It's
very rare. But it is something

245
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,040
right now, we're only in the Bay
Area, because one of the things

246
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,700
we wanted to make sure is like,
be really successful in a small

247
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,240
radius, such that you can ensure
that your customers get their

248
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,000
work out the kinks, keep them
running, for sure. Actually,

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,420
when we first started, we did
the service ourselves. So we

250
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,890
became drywall subcontractors,
and hire tapers onto our

251
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:17,970
payroll, and have our own people
running it right. And that was

252
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,730
really important. Because for
the customers, I'm excited about

253
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,400
the idea of a robot. I'm not
really sure how it's gonna work

254
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,180
for me. So we said, Fine, you
buy drywall at $1 for you know,

255
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,720
certain dollars per square foot,
a canvas the same amount. And

256
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,150
we'll get it done, right. We
just got into AP robots that do

257
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:37,230
it with our operators. So that
was the first two, three years,

258
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,230
once they started working and
really like saw how it works,

259
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,470
and they're like, oh, okay, this
works into my workflow. They

260
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,140
started saying, Okay, now we
want to run it right? We want to

261
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,480
scale up with it. So that's
really the transition point

262
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,110
we've entered around the middle
of last year is really saying,

263
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,920
okay, the robots that a state
that you guys can run it will

264
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,440
rent it to you and we'll help
you make sure it's successful.

265
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,829
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. That's
really Cool. So it sounds like

266
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:06,689
it was extremely iterative to
get to where you are now, would

267
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:09,119
you? Would you tell me a bit
about that like, so now, I

268
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:13,499
assume you guys are somewhat of
drywall experts. But like, you

269
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:17,549
have this problem, and you think
it's going to be a valuable good

270
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:24,359
big value add kind of thing. And
then you start in this way that

271
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:26,909
you were talking about where you
work with the contractors, and

272
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:30,149
you basically become the
contractors, but hire people to

273
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:33,599
amend your robot. And then
growing that to the point where

274
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,539
it's like useful enough that you
can just give it to that

275
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:39,509
contractors to do with
themselves. Like, just tell me a

276
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:40,709
bit about that whole process?

277
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,370
Maria Telleria: Sure, one of the
big things from the beginning

278
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,180
has been testing on site as
quickly as possible, right. So

279
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,060
the very early tests, like, I
mean, probably now I'd be

280
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,470
embarrassed to call that a
robotic system. But you know, it

281
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,730
has to be moved manually

282
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,510
Audrow Nash: to cart. It's so
funny that one

283
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,970
Maria Telleria: of our team
members is much stronger than

284
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,570
being so he had to come to every
site because exactly how to

285
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,400
position the robot. But it was a
way to do point break on paper.

286
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,480
And in the lab, there's a lot of
value. But we all know that the

287
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,230
real issue is this. So we took
out that, you know, cart with a

288
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,380
robot arm demonstrated that they
kept iterating, right? We're

289
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,230
like, Okay, we can't hire, you
know, just a person to move the

290
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,490
robot. So we ended the mobile
things, and all of that. In with

291
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,850
that we did learn a lot about
drywall finishing itself. But

292
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,820
even before very early, when
we're going to do drywall

293
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,850
finishing. Yeah, let's hire
somebody who knows what the

294
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,300
drywall finishing is. So we
brought on team members who, you

295
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,770
know, years of expertise, you
know, journeyman unique people

296
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,490
themselves who just been trained
in that skill. And when I sat

297
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,570
next to them, I really said,
Okay, how do we get to that

298
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,240
level? The really interesting
part, their radius, and we were

299
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,270
both learning from each other,
right? Because people have

300
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,090
optimized the street incredibly
right standings that were

301
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,820
sparked. So they bought to my
stick to reduce the amount of

302
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,690
Sandy. You know, so when we've
reached brought them in, and

303
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,640
what I think a lot of people
think with robotics is like,

304
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,550
Okay, well, let's do what the
person does. But we have to take

305
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,340
a step back and be like, your
constraints are different,

306
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,670
right? Yep. Standing robot
doesn't care, you know, I'll

307
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,210
say, we'll spray whatever you
tell it to do, it'll do it. And

308
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,190
so if you remove that
constraint, maybe you approach

309
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,520
it differently. And so you sold
the video, we applied all of the

310
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,760
material in one go, and then
Stanmore versus a person applies

311
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,810
that day over day slip, slip on,
sorry, slowly building up the

312
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,690
profile that they want to get,
and then just stance a little

313
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,470
bit at the end. So

314
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,320
Audrow Nash: is it so it dries
like you, you keep letting it

315
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,230
dry, so it drives very evenly,
because you do like thin layer

316
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,810
after thin layer, where each
layer can be quite even. And

317
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,580
therefore the whole thing
appears even?

318
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,780
Maria Telleria: Yeah, it's
really minimal. That minimal

319
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,840
sanding and you need to use kind
of the data breaks of the sheets

320
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,270
gonna look like this, there's a
gap between them and use the

321
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,810
edges to apply the material, but
then that shrinks. And as it

322
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,090
dries, so then the next day, you
come in with like, a little bit

323
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,240
bigger, and you use the next
data. And this is how people do

324
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,670
it, right, because they need a
reference point, they need to

325
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,150
touch the wall. And it means to
your point, they have to be thin

326
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,700
layers, they have to wait till
it dries, even though maybe

327
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,530
they're done for the day. And
they're like, Oh, I wish I could

328
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,050
apply the next coat. Because
it's right, you can't do

329
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:25,110
anything. As we looked at me,
like, oh, robot doesn't need

330
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,710
that data, right? It has this
really good map around it. It

331
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,290
can spray material very
consistently versus a person,

332
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,470
right? Imagine trying to move a
point one meters a second, for

333
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,820
eight hours a day, might be a
little hard. It was sitting with

334
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,300
each other and be like, Okay,
you guys do it this way. But

335
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,360
you're also really good at
adaptability, you're also

336
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,360
getting the world's best
feedback control system through

337
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,760
vision to touch right, the
amount that they gather through

338
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,480
their touch is incredible. And
then we said, well, robots don't

339
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,560
have that. But they have really
high repeatability. Right. And

340
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,110
that's it, they don't get tired
of sanding. So is it Oh, and

341
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,210
then let's make the process a
little bit differently. Let's

342
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,780
make a process that the robot
can be successful at, apply all

343
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,020
the material ones, and then sand
a lot. But you're really using

344
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,630
the things that the robot is
good at, and not depending on

345
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,650
what people are good at.

346
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,530
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So I
imagined during this, there's a

347
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:22,170
lot of like, picking the brain
of the tapers, and your roll up

348
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,230
your roboticists to really try
to understand kind of like,

349
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,990
what's the whole process what's
actually being done, not just

350
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,270
the way that they do it, so
you're not trying to recreate

351
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,990
what they're doing. And then
from there, you try to then

352
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,920
optimize for what's best with
the robot, given the way that

353
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,500
the robot behaves and what it's
good at and what it's not.

354
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,410
Maria Telleria: Exactly, yeah, I
think that's the right way to

355
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,890
think about it is like what are
you trying to accomplish? Not

356
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,200
necessarily how but let's start
with what are you trying to

357
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,130
accomplish? And then we can work
out the how and the actually are

358
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,160
the people we had to reassess
our superintendent. You know,

359
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,050
she came with all this
experience. So one of the first

360
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,690
things she was like, You guys
have to take care So you don't

361
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,110
have all the engineers out there
we take. I don't think we've

362
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,500
passed her quality standard yet,
but she lets us run the robot.

363
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,570
But it was a little bit of like,
yeah, I understand why you're

364
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,880
doing it. And it was seeing
those things and understanding

365
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,980
that we're like, Okay, well,
that would be difficult for a

366
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,710
robot. What were you trying to
do is create this profile? Okay.

367
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,350
Well, there's other ways to
create a profile, right? If the

368
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,340
same constraints,

369
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,610
Audrow Nash: can you tell me
some of the difficulties about

370
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,390
spraying and sanding that you
guys came across?

371
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,560
Maria Telleria: Definitely in
the spring side, right, that

372
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,610
that consistency, you are the
one deliver delivers about three

373
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,520
and a half gallons per minute.
So it's a lot of material coming

374
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,660
pretty fast. And you have to
apply it fairly consistently. So

375
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,970
that all sounds for you don't
robot can do that. The problem

376
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,390
is more. And I guess, upstream,
if you will, the materials that

377
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,840
have been developed so far have
been for people. And so they're

378
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,360
not very tightly controlled
materials, right? The viscosity

379
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,840
varies widely, which when you're
assuming that you have the same

380
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,450
viscosity, and you get the same
result, that assumption, yeah,

381
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:07,440
exactly the problem versus but
from the manufacturer side,

382
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,560
they've always had the person in
the loop. People like their own,

383
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,610
you know, viscosity, so they add
a little bit more water a little

384
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,280
bit less. So it's, for them,
it's also not worth it to

385
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,830
optimize to a certain thing,
because people are so varied.

386
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,980
Right? So you, that was one of
our biggest challenges. We're

387
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,880
working with a material that is
not designed for robotic, right?

388
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,360
Imagine like paints that go into
painting your car, I'm sure

389
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,180
there's very little variation
when they go into that paint

390
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,490
shop. Right? And then the robot
sure does its thing, and it's

391
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,010
going to be great. We were
working with materials that

392
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,620
weren't designed for that. So we
had to think a lot about like,

393
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,830
how do we close the loop on
that? And again, hey, how do we

394
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,650
use the operator who knows that
to help us close the loop? So

395
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,770
the the helped us a little bit
with preparing the material to

396
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,990
the right one, but also
providing that feedback of it's

397
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,320
still in? Well, I would say
that's the biggest challenge

398
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,010
with the spraying is the
material itself and modeling

399
00:21:59,010 --> 00:21:59,340
that.

400
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,910
Audrow Nash: So how does it
work? Now the person gives you

401
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:07,080
feedback on how it is, but they
do some prep work. So make it so

402
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,630
it's like a fairly consistent
viscosity, or

403
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,630
Maria Telleria: we'll kind of
give them some guidelines, but

404
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,970
they do have to the material
comes in, it's a little too

405
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:18,840
thick for spring. And so they
have to thin it down with some

406
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,300
water. But this is where we've
seen right at the beginning, we

407
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,380
were like, only at this amount
of water, you know, and that's

408
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,240
where they provided the feedback
and a lot. So that we started

409
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,780
being like, okay, let's be more
descriptive, get into this type

410
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,990
of consistency, right makes me
think of the baking shows, to

411
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:42,060
the peaks. So we started being
more rounded, like, Okay, what

412
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,330
we really need to do is to get
it to this consistency. And then

413
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,640
they use their own feedback
system to be like, Oh, well,

414
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,000
this batch was a little bit more
liquid, I'm only gonna add half

415
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,790
the water that I normally do our
dispatch in this actually

416
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,280
temperature dependent to when
it's really cold and material.

417
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,380
So yeah, everything that could
be different about it are

418
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,430
processing. So as a couple,
everything is variable. And we

419
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:08,970
need to declare a process that
achieves the right result, even

420
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,990
with all that variability.

421
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:13,170
Audrow Nash: Have you ever I'm
sure you consider this, but I'd

422
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,290
like to hear your thoughts on it
anyways, did you ever think of

423
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:20,010
working with a manufacturer of
these materials to try to like

424
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,850
get them to control it pretty
consistently. So you could, I

425
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,410
don't know, work with it more
easily.

426
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,470
Maria Telleria: Like where your
head is that we have, and

427
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,430
they've been really great. I
think they also see a place

428
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,760
where introducer robotics,
robotics also allows you to

429
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,880
maybe improved on the materials,
because again, your constraints

430
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,340
have changed. So they've been
great. We've been working with

431
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,580
them for since the beginning,
really. But you also have to

432
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:49,080
manage that when, like, what's
already acceptable on site. So,

433
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,630
you know, we kind of did it in
parallel said, like, let's work

434
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,380
with, again, as few barriers as
possible for our customers. So

435
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,620
you know, no map, no, this.
Okay, let's also develop the

436
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,320
site because there is a future
work, you know, don't have a

437
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,990
better result. So that's
happening. Yeah, they've been

438
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:07,260
great. I think they also see the
vision and especially their

439
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,900
scientists get excited, right?
Because, like giving them a new

440
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,230
design space, the design space
for people, is this, the design

441
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,110
space for robotics, like, Oh,
you wanted 1.3 millimeters

442
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,660
thick? Done? We'll do that for
you. And then what? Well,

443
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,820
Audrow Nash: that's so funny.
Yeah, it is interesting. It's so

444
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,510
it's so interesting to consider
when you change the constrained

445
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,960
space, like you were working
with people, people are really

446
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,420
good at certain things, not good
at other things. And now you

447
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,540
take a robot totally good at
different things and bad at

448
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,120
other things. And so it's like,
okay, you can use the best of

449
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,760
both. And this is very
interesting. It's an interesting

450
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,390
spot to be.

451
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:49,980
Maria Telleria: Yeah, they're
just like, Oh, these ideas like

452
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,610
constrained space of cost,
because it is a very labor

453
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,790
intensive task. The materials
budget, if you will, is very

454
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,820
small, right. It's all when the
cost has gone to labor.

455
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,380
especially as things get harder
and harder, it's just so with

456
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,990
the materials manufacturers will
also have that conversation of

457
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,540
like, hey, maybe you can have a
little bit more expensive

458
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:13,350
material, if it gives you more
productivity. That works, right.

459
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,080
And so they also start seeing
the idea of maybe there's

460
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,620
greener materials, you know, or
materials would better, and

461
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,750
properties, right? What if we
could have better sound

462
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,200
absorption in your drywall
walls, or you get into really

463
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,680
cool spaces once you start
opening up that space? And so I

464
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,010
think we're really excited for
that future where you a robotics

465
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,470
coming in also change some other
of the upstream

466
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,780
Audrow Nash: assumptions. Yeah,
it's so interesting. So if you

467
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,900
can almost, I mean, like, if you
take this to the limit, where

468
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,080
you have like, infinite robots
flying this and all the dry

469
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,350
walls are, so then you have the
robots already. And then it's

470
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,170
basically free to have the
robots do it other than like,

471
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,570
the cost of energy and
transporting them and this kind

472
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:55,320
of thing. And then maybe, like,
really nice, highly optimized

473
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,810
materials, because and then the
materials cost rises. But the

474
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,990
total cost even in like, would
be less because the robot would

475
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:07,410
be affected, effectively free
labor. That would be very cool.

476
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,530
I like where that the like, new
potential optimisation space? Or

477
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,900
I don't know if space you can
optimize? That seems awesome.

478
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:20,040
Maria Telleria: Oh, yeah. For us
the you know, it really, we will

479
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,990
always have that operator in the
loop. So it's about their costs,

480
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,350
because there'll be time
spreading it over more square

481
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,650
footage, right? If Yeah, I
produce 1000 square feet in one

482
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,260
day. That's something if I could
do 2000 square feet. Now there's

483
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,480
that ROOM FOR THEM materials,
there's that room for that

484
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,810
optimization? So no, I think
that that gets pretty exciting

485
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:43,800
for us. And it also protects
their themselves where they can

486
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,190
have a longer career while we're
working with better materials

487
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,560
and better things. So it's kind
of this win win by really

488
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,570
thinking about that
augmentation, because it's about

489
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,290
the how much can that person
produce? Rather than replacing

490
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,280
them? Not necessary? It's better
to augment what they can do.

491
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,540
Right? Yeah, not necessary,

492
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,730
Audrow Nash: and probably not
even possible to because you

493
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:07,800
need their expertise. I was
thinking, it's a little bit like

494
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,890
the grocery store model, like
the clerk where you have one

495
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,400
person Manning 10, registers,
but this kind of thing, but it's

496
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,040
also different in that the
person is highly, highly

497
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,340
skilled, which may puts it into
an interesting space.

498
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,880
Maria Telleria: Yeah, that's a
really good analogy. I think

499
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,280
this idea of like, I can
supervise more, but you know, my

500
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,340
job does change. Right now
they're much more technical it

501
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,550
is, they're much more customer
success, right? Making sure that

502
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,340
they're making these things.
It's kind of how things evolve.

503
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,820
But if you completely tried to
remove the person, I think once

504
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,570
your body senses to that gets
really hard, why not utilize

505
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,480
them with their best, like,
utilize their, you know, their

506
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,060
adaptability, their smarts? We
don't have to wear down their

507
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,530
shoulder to get this word. Yes.

508
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:55,710
Audrow Nash: It sounds awful.
For sure, for so with this, I

509
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:01,200
How, how has the building
climate, like economic climate?

510
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:06,180
And in that, like I've had
several interviews, where

511
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,800
there's shortages and people to
do different work, is there a

512
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:15,120
shortage of tapers? Or is it
like, does this let you stretch

513
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,040
it taper to do what 20 tapers
could do? Or like, is there a

514
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,690
big shortage there? Also,

515
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,620
Maria Telleria: construction is
facing an incredible shortage,

516
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,410
you know, across all traits.
vaping is definitely one of

517
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:32,340
them. It's you know, one in 40%
stand shoulder surgery. Oh,

518
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,640
that's so bad. Yeah, yeah. And
you know those things, right.

519
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,310
They maybe fix it, but it's
never the same. And so they

520
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,730
often either have to retire
early, or you know, work live

521
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:42,510
with that pain, which

522
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:45,059
Audrow Nash: is that's because
of the sanding, the like,

523
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,670
Maria Telleria: sanding, that
repetitive motion on your

524
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:51,120
rotator cuff. Right? Oh, god.
Yeah, ceilings, also really

525
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,250
hard. There's also a dust, which
the sandy part? Exactly. They

526
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,010
optimized to reduce it, but it's
still there. And even if you're

527
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,650
not standing that much use the
tools that they pick up, you

528
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:06,510
know, 10 to 20 pounds and their
hours. Yeah, that's crazy.

529
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,990
Somebody's just wears down on
you. It's icy really? Yeah,

530
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,650
think about that. The it's been
really hard for like the union

531
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,800
where we work very closely with
to recruit new people. You can

532
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,650
see that right. It's like, such
a really good paying job. Like I

533
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,040
said, it's amazing the skill
these people have, but when you

534
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,660
put them in front of like, maybe
he'll return 50 Your shoulder

535
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,660
will be blown out because their
shoulder. Exactly. And you're

536
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,000
definitely be hurting. You know,
at the end of the day, you're

537
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,940
gonna have a long day and you're
just Yeah, so I think it's hard

538
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,460
for them to bring in thankful
dust themselves, right? They're

539
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,100
having a really hard time
bringing people in, even with

540
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,340
the people we have. There's a
lot of work right, we have to

541
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,370
double our building stock and
there's just not enough people.

542
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,790
The shortage in construction is
just outstanding. Yeah. So how

543
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,550
do you bring new people in and I
think that's giving them to so

544
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,250
then you are excited to do that
work like Oh, for sure. You

545
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,970
know, I could protect myself and
then also for those people that

546
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,920
You do bring in getting more
done.

547
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,070
Audrow Nash: You're letting them
be, like craftsmen with

548
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,740
underlings kind of thing. It's
like the apprentice model. But

549
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,320
the robots are the apprentice in
a sense, that does some of the

550
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,420
work. That's really cool. What
do you so just Just curious on

551
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:19,680
your perspective on this? So do
you think it's the more skilled

552
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:25,410
jobs that are harder to fill? Or
the less skilled jobs in the

553
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,710
construction industry? Like, is
it? Is it the tapers or I don't

554
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:33,570
know, the general construction
worker? That I assume the

555
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,870
shortage is in both? But are
they kind of is it more in the

556
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,720
tapering area or more in the
general worker? area?

557
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,460
Maria Telleria: I don't know
exactly. But my sense is, in

558
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,420
general, everybody's having a
shortage, but you see it in

559
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:53,490
those harder on your body. So I
think they all have like our

560
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,540
journey men that we work with is
a believe a four year process to

561
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,700
get trained. So it's a long
apprenticeship. Similar

562
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,180
electricians have to have their
apprenticeship. But the wear and

563
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,570
tear is not equivalent across
trades. So I think trade like

564
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,930
drywall finishing, in particular
suffer from that, like, well, if

565
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,320
I'm gonna pick a trade, I might
pick one that is not as hard on

566
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,450
my body or before, they were in
a different time. And people see

567
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,610
you like our controller, and
they get excited, right? They

568
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,980
this is things that grown up
with, it looks like an Xbox

569
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,190
controller. It's a robot. So
there's also that like,

570
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,790
engagement of like, I'm working
with a really cool tool. So I

571
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,570
think between that in making
their day to day just be a lot

572
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:36,720
less painful. Yeah, it's the
right way to bring people in.

573
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,660
Audrow Nash: I imagine it's like
the you keep that because I

574
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,540
imagine that they got into it,
because they enjoy it somewhat

575
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,890
like the meticulous attention
required for this kind of task.

576
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:50,250
I imagine like I mean, I love
programming. And it's like the

577
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,330
same kind of thing, I imagine
where it's, I enjoy the details.

578
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,560
And so I can imagine them
enjoying the details. And in

579
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,440
this case, they get to they love
the inspection, they love going

580
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,020
this needs a little more of
this. And then the problem

581
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,360
solving that probably goes along
with it that I don't understand

582
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,980
what it would be. But so you let
them do that. But you let them

583
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,790
delegate all of that repetitive
work to the robot. That seems

584
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,600
really great to me.

585
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,530
Maria Telleria: Like you said,
Yeah, that's right that the

586
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,800
people have on their workers you
know, they love Yeah, created

587
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,200
that your wall looks amazing,
right? This those walls, they

588
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,320
call them like walls where you
have like, the skylight that

589
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,590
shines on it is glossy, when you
know, the architect really went

590
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:34,140
out laughing to get something
like that they look beautiful.

591
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,710
So there's a ton of pride and a
lot of our feedback with them

592
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,770
working especially on the user
interfaces, how do I give you

593
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:44,550
that ability to use your crap to
use that and get that

594
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,580
engagement, right? Because they
do want to keep that in theirs?

595
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,920
You know, they want to keep that
pride that's building up for

596
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,400
years of training, you know,
that you're, you're that person,

597
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,370
not everybody can do it. Right.
So even if I gave you the robot,

598
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,750
we could easily get you trained,
probably faster. But I don't

599
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,380
Audrow Nash: click a giant hole.
And it's like, no, no, it's

600
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,540
good. Other than that, yeah,
just put that picture as the

601
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:17,400
plant over there. Yeah, that
sounds very funny. Okay, so what

602
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,580
what other challenges did you
have with so sit spraying the

603
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,810
big challenge was the viscosity?
Were there big challenges with

604
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,390
sanding as well? Or was that
kind of straightforward?

605
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,560
Maria Telleria: No 10 Things
really where we started with a,

606
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,190
like a research phase, because
sanding requires contacting the

607
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:39,150
surface, right? A lot of the,
you know, robots started a lot

608
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,190
in welding. That was nice,
because you have that little bit

609
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,560
like, I don't have to be perfect
as long as I can get the arc

610
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,590
across it good enough, right.
And then of course, you say,

611
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,660
well control everything around
it, and then we're gonna get

612
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,480
there. But the moment you needed
to stand, you needed to have

613
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,960
that contract. And it's not
just, you know, the, I guess,

614
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,570
this sense of the wall, but
like, your angle of approach,

615
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,350
and that soft materials I was
mentioning, so that was a lot of

616
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,770
our work was like, how do you
make this thing happen without a

617
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,920
perfect map? Right? We do map
our own space, but you're gonna

618
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,850
get there's still

619
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,610
Audrow Nash: accuracy, right?
Yeah. So that's three

620
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:15,720
centimeters. Okay, that's pretty
big. For a precise job.

621
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,930
Maria Telleria: Yeah, exactly.
And so part of that is just your

622
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:19,500
project is

623
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,890
Audrow Nash: probably not more
than not much more than three

624
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:23,610
centimeters.

625
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,370
Maria Telleria: Yeah, it's about
Yeah, I'm gonna go two inches,

626
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:29,730
but like half inch drywall is
very common. I mean, we put up

627
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,610
Audrow Nash: yeah, that's three
centimeters or something. 2.4 or

628
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,860
whatever it is. Or so you.

629
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,980
Maria Telleria: So you might not
be right, you know, know

630
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,010
exactly, plus or minus. So
really about thinking about how

631
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,860
do you approach that Walbert? I
have a good guess where it is. I

632
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,430
have a good guess of the angle
that it is. But I want to make

633
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:50,610
that really soft contact, right
because I can scratch it. I'm

634
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,550
going to create more damage. So
this is where other research

635
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,070
came back to compliance. We
really thought that one of the

636
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:59,220
ways to get robots out into the
world is make them compliant,

637
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,340
right? They don't have To be,
have a perfect map as long as

638
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,460
you can tolerate that. And by
doing compliance, so we build a

639
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,640
ton of compliance into our
sending end effectors such that

640
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,640
you do your best to get the best
map, but then you say, at the

641
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,250
end of the day, I'm going to
have to, you know, start this,

642
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:18,060
the reality to like, the joints
will be like hump or zip. And

643
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,330
you don't want to like fault or
cut through that hump, you

644
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,910
actually want to write it out,
that's what people do is that

645
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,150
reflect is just the illusion of
flat. So you also need that your

646
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,300
Sandy had to kind of write that
hump and spread it out. So it's,

647
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:34,050
that was a lot of work. And, you
know, we have like, four years

648
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:37,500
of research with the government
before even doing this that

649
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:38,910
leverage.

650
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,780
Audrow Nash: So what do you mean
compliance in this? Is it like,

651
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,290
springs? Or do you mean like,
what what do you mean by

652
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,280
compliance? I guess?

653
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,650
Maria Telleria: Yeah, in
general, we're looking at it,

654
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,690
achieving it whichever way you
want, right? Because spring is a

655
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:55,050
perfect example where it allows
you to right absorbed that

656
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,060
positioning. Exactly. So we
look, you know, their spring

657
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,390
scampers, but also under your
control side, how do you detect

658
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,810
that compliance and react to it?
So you don't have to have all of

659
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:10,440
your compliance be mechanical,
some of it can be coming in from

660
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,340
your control system?

661
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,640
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So do you
do a mix, where you might have

662
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,640
some, you might have something
so you have the sanding head,

663
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,820
and then you might have
something where it can kind of

664
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:25,110
move a little bit given, like
with a spring? I don't know,

665
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,720
keeping it kind of facing
forward. But like giving up

666
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:31,260
giving a little bit if the wall
is a slightly different shape

667
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:35,040
than you expect? And then you do
it in hardware? Or in software

668
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,770
to where, hmm, and that's, you
kind of just do emulate

669
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,570
additional springs in the, in
the motors or what do you? What

670
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,530
kind of approach is that?

671
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,380
Maria Telleria: Yeah, there's a
few ways. But one could just be,

672
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,430
you know, enabling, or sensing
that mechanical displacement, if

673
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,580
you will, that you're having and
then utilizing your software to

674
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,760
give you a larger range, right?
So you're coming in like this,

675
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,830
and you're already detecting but
you're going to hit your heart

676
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:05,910
stop, you go ahead and like tilt
your arm, which some of it is

677
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,330
more like a feedback. But
there's other ways, right? How

678
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,810
you run your control system
around it, allowing me to, you

679
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,450
know, be tolerant, right? My
ultimate goal is not perfect

680
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:19,050
position. My ultimate goal is
perfect force, right? constant

681
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,300
force it elsewhere control
system.

682
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,900
Audrow Nash: Your goal is
constant force is that is that

683
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:29,010
that's really useful for
sanding. Interesting,

684
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,710
Maria Telleria: okay, that this
goes back to that hump where you

685
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,790
want to write those out and
like, apply the right force to

686
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,670
level it out. But I don't
necessarily want to grind down.

687
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,120
Yeah. Because that's even going
to get through the other side of

688
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,820
drywall. One of the big
challenge rates is it's not just

689
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,490
the drywall, but it's how it was
formed. So if somebody didn't

690
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,710
hanger very well, you have that?
And then how it was framed?

691
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,890
Yeah. So all sudden, you start,
like, there's a lot of personal

692
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,430
for sure. Yeah, they're the ones
who fix everybody's mistakes.

693
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,020
Everybody, it's true, right?
It's like accumulation of the

694
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,560
error that then you have to then
they refined back. So you need

695
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,060
that. That approach of, you
know, let's move that out, not

696
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,320
necessarily flattening it out.

697
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,740
Audrow Nash: So if you have a
hump in your drywall, so it's

698
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,680
hanging, and there's a hump, and
you're trying to apply a

699
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,610
constant force throughout it.
Now what I'm thinking, if you

700
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:24,690
had a point sander, like, then
it would just make everything

701
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,800
deeper, like shorter into the
material by the same amount, but

702
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,990
because you have a, I don't
know, a sander that has an area,

703
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,960
and you move it around, it kind
of averages everything out. And

704
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,990
that's why constant pressure is
important. Is it correct or?

705
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:42,569
Maria Telleria: Yep, that's
correct. Yeah. And then you also

706
00:38:42,569 --> 00:38:47,369
have to look at, you know,
having your compliance also in

707
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:51,029
your tip tilt, so that you can
can also write out that thing.

708
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:53,129
Good. both axes, right. You want
to be able to

709
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,610
Audrow Nash: adjust different
ways. Yeah, I was. My

710
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:03,810
explanation was 2d, but yeah.
Yeah, I imagine the same thing

711
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:09,030
holds true. 2d and 3d for that.
Okay, and how do you get your

712
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,190
initial map? For the robot?

713
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,970
Maria Telleria: Yeah, we use a
lidar system to create our map,

714
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,850
you know, and then from the
point cloud, because this also

715
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,130
has to be fairly fast, right?
Anytime that you're not running

716
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,820
the tool, it's not productive
time. So from the point cloud,

717
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,720
find the planes and then work
off of those, subdivide them

718
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,810
into spaces. So it's a little
bit it's, it's a different

719
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:34,320
application, right? So much work
around LiDAR, some point clouds,

720
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,750
but it's what are you trying to
do with it? For us? It's finding

721
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,110
surfaces, right, as opposed to
maybe identifying objects like

722
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,880
an autonomous car has to do.

723
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,670
Audrow Nash: So do you? Is it
like a person carries around

724
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:47,760
something or do you drive your
robot by it or how does it work?

725
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,760
Maria Telleria: We drive the
robot by it. So the operator

726
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,420
they have a little like, do a
little loop and they get some

727
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,970
feedback from the user interface
if we're getting a good little

728
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:01,620
good map, and then they also get
to do once it pops up, they can

729
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,740
use again their smarts to say
like, I'm missing a wall or

730
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,430
something like that.

731
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:09,839
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Was that
part pretty straightforward? Or

732
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:14,339
was that there? Was there
challenges there too? Yeah,

733
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:16,229
Maria Telleria: I would say,
definitely feels more

734
00:40:16,229 --> 00:40:18,839
straightforward because it is
mostly a technical challenges.

735
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:21,179
And you know, sometimes I get
excited when we find just

736
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:21,629
technical.

737
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,440
Audrow Nash: Because it'll be
one thing that's relatively easy

738
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,960
and fairly established to Yeah.

739
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,540
Maria Telleria: Don't get me
wrong, right. It took a lot of

740
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,630
work and optimizing and getting
it right. And we're all still

741
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,720
tuning and stuff. But it is
something that like, it's well

742
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,800
within our control. And probably
one of the, it's a little bit of

743
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,130
a challenge. But also exciting
is the technology advancements

744
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:47,610
on the lighter side has been
incredible for starting. So a

745
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,580
lot of it has actually been
like, Okay, should we upgrade to

746
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,120
the next LIDAR? And that means
retuning our mapping algorithm

747
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,880
and so play that trade off. Yep.
But yeah, I like those

748
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,220
challenges that are mostly
technical, not that the other

749
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,050
ones are interesting. But
definitely, when you're trying

750
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:04,740
to change people's perceptions,
or construction business

751
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,870
alignments, you're just like,
well, that's a lot harder.

752
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,520
Audrow Nash: Oh, totally, I
think. To me, it seems like

753
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,910
successful companies are founded
on just a few very hard

754
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,610
challenges like one or like two
or something like this, this is

755
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:20,820
your sanding and spraying. But
if it was like every single

756
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,350
thing is an incredible, like
moonshot, then it probably

757
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,200
wouldn't be a good long term bet
for the company, because one of

758
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,320
those moonshots will be a giant
bottleneck, or those kinds of

759
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,140
thing. So it is nice when you
have just an engineering

760
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:34,710
problem.

761
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,680
Maria Telleria: definitely agree
that we think about it, it's

762
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,260
like, let's make sure you're
successful with like, just just

763
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,020
two or three challenges they're
picking up. Yep. And then we

764
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,150
talked about material
development, that's great, but

765
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:50,130
don't depend on that. It's a
longer timeline. But so we work

766
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:53,700
on some of this research on the
side. And as those kind of get

767
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:57,780
proven out, we end up but you
cannot keep this team running on

768
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:58,950
more researchy stuff.

769
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,770
Audrow Nash: And it's almost
like a parallel thread to the

770
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:05,010
main value add for the company.
So it's like, we're going to be

771
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:08,280
around in 10 years and like,
then maybe that'll kick in. And

772
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,770
we can have these conversations
now. But they're not like,

773
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:15,210
you're not waiting to be a
profitable company before. For

774
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:18,720
that to work. It's like, we got
it we can we can just make do we

775
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,510
have to mix it to approximately
the same consistency. And it's

776
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:21,990
all fine.

777
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:26,549
Maria Telleria: Exactly. Yeah,
just sure you provide value at

778
00:42:26,549 --> 00:42:28,769
that point to the customer,
right? Because they're like,

779
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:32,249
that's great that you're gonna
do that in seven years. But I

780
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,959
have a project tomorrow, what
can you do?

781
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:37,530
Audrow Nash: And venture
capitalists are like, Oh, seven

782
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,740
years, I think you'll start to
be it's like, oh, it's a

783
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:44,130
robotics company with all got
all the infrastructure and

784
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:46,140
funding that that requires?
Yeah,

785
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,420
Maria Telleria: exactly. It is
definitely yeah, that's where

786
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,810
you I think you really want to
show this inability to get out

787
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:55,590
on site sooner. And so having
those things and I act, do you

788
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:59,610
know, where we began, where it's
like, keep the person allowed

789
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,610
them to do that helped you get
to that place, right? And that's

790
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,730
why it's both, I think, the
right way to do it for Mark

791
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,980
values, but also the right way
to do it. When you look at the

792
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,590
problem, you're like, Okay,
let's do that. Let's get the

793
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,270
person in there and help us get
out there.

794
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,370
Audrow Nash: And so I'm, I'm
torn between two segues for this

795
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,160
the first one. So how are you?
So we talked, I mentioned just a

796
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,050
little bit with like venture
capital in this kind of thing.

797
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,190
How are you guys funded?

798
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,550
Maria Telleria: Yet, we're a
venture backed, we raised our

799
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:33,300
series B, about a year, a little
bit over a year ago. So it's

800
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,330
been great. We previous to that,
like I mentioned a little bit

801
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,850
was we were doing research for
the government. So we did have

802
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:43,050
some NRA dollars. So it was a
great way to develop the A get

803
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:46,260
back to your point, to many
problems. So research was a

804
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,410
great place. So we worked with
NASA and Office of Naval

805
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,600
Research, they were really
looking at this, you know,

806
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,600
compliance in the spaces. You
know, they're the most

807
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,800
unstructured of spaces. So then
we we sold some of them. Yeah,

808
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:02,670
in construction, much better.
And yeah, once we really found

809
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:05,790
that application, that was
another decision for us is like

810
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:10,230
the, you know, the Swiss Army
knife of robotics. That's pretty

811
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,990
hard to do, right? Trying to
solve all those problems. So we

812
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:15,510
knew we couldn't just be the
construction robot that did

813
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:19,110
everything we've said, let's
find one trade, one task that we

814
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:22,080
do really well. Yeah. And then
from there, we can expand. And

815
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,950
so once we found the task, and
we had demonstrated that there

816
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:30,000
was value with the current
technical challenges as opposed

817
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,350
to future, that's when we went
and fundraise around and did a

818
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,800
follow up round in 2020. Gotcha.

819
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,300
Audrow Nash: That's exciting.
Oh, yeah. Can you talk a little

820
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,750
bit about kind of bringing on
investors and the process of

821
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:50,010
that because getting really
savvy investors can be a huge

822
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:54,570
benefit, but getting ones that
have like incredibly draconian

823
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:58,170
clauses and flood their funding
agreements can I've seen it kill

824
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,680
several companies? So I Assuming
you guys are doing fantastic,

825
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:04,950
like, it sounds like things are
really good. But would you tell

826
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,290
me a little bit about kind of
picking the right investors?

827
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,680
Maria Telleria: Yeah, I think a
big challenge is when your

828
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,770
hardware, you're already
probably looking at a different

829
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:17,220
space of investors, right? At
least here in the Valley. It's

830
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,400
like, there's so so many
investing firms, but you should

831
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:24,060
research what they invest in,
what are the pieces, right? If

832
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,960
they've never done a hardware
company, let alone a robotics

833
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,470
company. They might not be the,
the right fit. And early on, we

834
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,930
talked to everybody. And then
very quickly, you realize, Oh,

835
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:37,620
you guys are used to software,
and all the software? And maybe

836
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,470
that's, you know, you guys are
great. But do we really see

837
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,020
like, are you set up in a way
where your fund can support

838
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,480
something like where you wanted
them to have secondaries because

839
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:52,710
we know this is a longer process
that you kind of like they can

840
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:55,530
come in and reinvest in the
future around so like, have you

841
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:59,100
researched, you know, they're
putting x amount into your first

842
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,790
round? Do the reserve some
amount? They don't have to use

843
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,890
it. But do they reserve some
amounts so that when you're

844
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:09,330
raising your next one, they can
reinvest it? It's just a nice

845
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:12,630
way to support that it I think,
it just shows that they thought

846
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,960
through like, look, this is not
going to be one round hit,

847
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:18,870
right, we are going to have to
develop it just the nature of

848
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:22,590
Harvard, it's a huge, awesome
win rate, the defensibility is

849
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:27,180
much higher, but it is a longer
path. So a lot for us was really

850
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:30,600
a search problem, right? Find
those people who do, who

851
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,150
understood us. And then to your
point of like kind of that

852
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,620
relationship, who supported one
that company we wanted to build,

853
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,920
but also brought in maybe the
areas that we weren't so good at

854
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,610
right and provided that guidance
and really served as advisors at

855
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:45,090
the center.

856
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,620
Audrow Nash: Now, so you
mentioned you have like 40 jobs

857
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:55,170
or so done so far. So I assume
this means you don't have that

858
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,440
maybe you probably have less
than 40 robots with this, which

859
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:03,570
makes me think less than, like,
it's not a manufacturing

860
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:08,190
problem, really for you guys,
because it's kind of so this is

861
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,530
interesting to me, because it
changes possibly the type of

862
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:13,950
investor that you would want to
get. Would you tell me a bit

863
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:14,550
about this?

864
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,610
Maria Telleria: Yeah, that's
definitely a big challenge,

865
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:21,690
right? It's We're just two
things, the way that we're

866
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:24,510
looking at it is breeding a lot
of value with one machine. So

867
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:28,530
we're not going to be a consumer
electronics, Molly, right, where

868
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:31,920
it's like literal value, but you
still didn't really know that

869
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,070
you're doing great, right? It's,
it's a much different approach

870
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:39,180
is much smaller volumes, but
create a lot of value for them.

871
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,580
So that already changes your
perspective on how you're going

872
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,820
to manufacture. Right, you're
not talking 1000s of units to

873
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,040
your point, right? We're talking
10s of units now and then

874
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,090
scaling up from there. It's your
design space changes from when

875
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:53,940
building it right, there's maybe
manufacturing methods that you

876
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,250
don't have as high X as you
might, you know, you can't

877
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,120
injection mold every piece, you
have to come up with another way

878
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,430
because you know, every move is
so expensive. They're like how

879
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:09,420
many un 20,000,020 20

880
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,590
Audrow Nash: million. That's
that sounds.

881
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:17,040
Maria Telleria: So it just makes
it a little bit but it so it

882
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,970
just comes again to pay you
create enough value and then

883
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:23,700
your product of the lifetime to
support it, right? Because it

884
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,910
can be an expensive product. But
if it runs over the lifetime,

885
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,090
and brings in the revenue, you
can actually have very good

886
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:33,030
payback periods. And that's been
a metric for us, like, Hey, make

887
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:36,300
sure this robot pays itself back
in within a year. And then you

888
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,840
have a five, five year lifetime.
Yeah, it's a good business

889
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,970
model, right, as opposed to
maybe it could be something

890
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:44,250
cheap. But if it only brings so
little value, so I think you're

891
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,850
really like have to look at
payback periods, to see if your

892
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:51,480
hardware has the right thing.
And then work with your design

893
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,920
team to say, Alright, how do you
get a good cost? What with

894
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,160
without access to maybe the
cheapest manufacturing methods

895
00:48:59,160 --> 00:48:59,910
that are out there?

896
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:01,950
Audrow Nash: Definitely, yeah,
it's a totally different problem

897
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,260
for this. And you can also kind
of embrace that it's not going

898
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:08,250
to be like the one off thing and
try to get it so you can make 10

899
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:13,920
of them at like, not very well
or not, like not as optimized as

900
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,460
possible to be the lowest costs.
But then you're focusing on kind

901
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,730
of the longevity of it, and then
it kind of pays itself back so

902
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:25,110
you can invest a little more.
How do you so I'm just

903
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:30,300
wondering, and maybe I'm a bit
naive with this how do you with

904
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,810
robotics being fairly new and
things coming out all the time?

905
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,240
Like you're getting a robotic
arm maybe it's fairly well

906
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,150
established? Maybe it's not and
then some of the light are how

907
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:42,390
do you predict how long
something will last is there?

908
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,390
Like like this kind of thing is
an interesting problem to me

909
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:47,730
because I don't know that every
part would have a track record

910
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:48,900
for many years.

911
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,950
Maria Telleria: Now you're 100%
corrected. Not every part has

912
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:55,740
said some parts do or mobile
basis actually we retrofit a

913
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,590
construction based on these
things actually fought for like,

914
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:02,400
I feel like you find everybody
years later be like, maybe

915
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,370
change the batteries. So it's
kind of going through your

916
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:08,340
components, and then also build
your model to be realistic,

917
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,490
those things that you're not
super sure about, or maybe

918
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:13,920
sensors that maybe they do have
the lifetime. But do you

919
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,740
actually want to keep it for
five years and be using that old

920
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,640
or the company could

921
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,790
Audrow Nash: die, and then it's
like, you have to support and

922
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:24,570
they had a closed, like a
closed, proprietary sensor

923
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:27,870
driver that you can access for
this kind of thing, no longer

924
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:30,900
works on a bun to 2026, or
whatever it will be in a couple

925
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,290
of years.

926
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,830
Maria Telleria: That's right.
It's a what we found is like, I

927
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:37,530
build that into the model. So is
that either we're not so sure

928
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:41,370
that the lifetime will be the
five years that we target? Okay,

929
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,470
just built in, that there's
going to be replacement parts,

930
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,840
or the ones that we're like,
we're not sure we're gonna want

931
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,350
to use this either company's not
stable, or, you know, there's a

932
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:52,080
much better sensor, why would I
still be using, you know, five

933
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,890
year old LIDAR technology when I
can get this one? That you build

934
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,990
that into your models? Like,
hey, there's gonna be so many

935
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:00,540
1000 flowers, so replacement
parts that I do over the

936
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,660
lifetime? Do I still get a good
payback period? Right? Does it

937
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,990
still pay itself off if I make
those changes, but of course,

938
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:09,330
you also don't want to be
changing them every minute, just

939
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:12,540
because it's a better sensor,
you gotta make that ROI analysis

940
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:16,080
for, for component, but do your
best and then keep really good

941
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,420
track, right, as we're out
there. We've been running now

942
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:23,250
for almost four years. So we
know that those machines are

943
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,440
still going. So that's good. But
you also have to keep track,

944
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:29,190
what things take your replays?
Was there any leading indicators

945
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:31,230
that could have told you that
you needed to replace that

946
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:34,290
before? A true failure? So you
know, predictive maintenance is

947
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:37,140
like this awesome future that,
you know, manufacturing and

948
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:40,320
logistics already has so many
cycles, but we're making sure

949
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,290
to, like collect the data. Now,
even if you're not sure what

950
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:45,870
you're looking for later, if you
have a failure, you can go back

951
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:52,080
increasing? A little bit more?
Yeah, what was my leading

952
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,030
indicator that would have told
me to replace it?

953
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,680
Audrow Nash: That's so
interesting, I've never really

954
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,100
thought about that. I really, I
like that perspective, you kind

955
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:02,010
of gather the data and then
after, and you just, like,

956
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:05,010
preemptively are gathering it,
because perhaps you'll be able

957
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:07,710
to see trends in the future. And
it's probably fairly cheap to

958
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:13,080
grab now. That's really cool.
Yeah, and I guess manufacturing

959
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:17,790
and logistics probably has that
down. But that's very cool for

960
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:19,470
you to apply to your systems.

961
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,190
Maria Telleria: Yeah, I think
some years ago, maybe the data

962
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:25,530
would have gone expensive. But
now it's so cheap that sometimes

963
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:28,200
when we do we need all this
data, that it's worth it to keep

964
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,060
it and then look back. And
there, there has been some

965
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,460
things where we've been able to
kind of look back and go, Oh,

966
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,670
okay, we saw that here. We saw
that there. Right? This is

967
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:38,220
starting to be at least
something to look out for,

968
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:40,590
right. And we put maintenance in
the week to service our

969
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,630
customers right after every job
that comes in and gets

970
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:45,360
inspected. And so we can at
least check for those things,

971
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:48,720
you know, and identify those
areas that okay, maybe built

972
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,510
into the model, that being a
batteries will be your place.

973
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:54,330
And let's go ahead and adjust
for that in the cost.

974
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:57,420
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Now, this
question, I don't know if it's

975
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:01,110
too early. But I wonder what
you're thinking around these

976
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:05,190
lines. So in my understanding,
when you take venture capital

977
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,280
money, they're typically
expecting an exit I hear like,

978
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,590
the timeline they say is 10
years, but it's often a lot

979
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:15,300
closer to five. I'm wondering,
and so there's several different

980
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,540
types of exit events. You can be
bought by someone you can IPO.

981
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,640
Or you can wait, I don't know if
there's other things too. Are

982
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,550
you where do you think do you
think you'll have what kind of

983
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,340
liquidation event Do you think
you guys will have at some

984
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:33,480
point? And what are thoughts
around that? I suppose.

985
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,240
Maria Telleria: Yeah, I plan
around and we've always thought

986
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,470
is like, built a successful
company. So build with the goal

987
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:44,280
of IPO or something like that,
in your mind. If you're doing

988
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:49,470
that successfully, the other
liquidation events? Yeah,

989
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:52,860
exactly. It's your think when
you build too, like acquisition,

990
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,710
you get into a really tricky
spot, right? Where like, you're

991
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,770
now trying to guess what they
want, or you build so much into

992
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:01,200
them. And then they're like,
actually, we decided we don't

993
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:08,610
like B vs. sustainable company,
right? Build a company. That's,

994
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,400
you know, at some point, you
stop taking venture capital, you

995
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,880
can produce your own things,
right? We want to expand drywall

996
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,460
finishing is our starting point,
we want to expand and really be

997
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,000
the tool that you just know that
Oh, but structure you use

998
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,450
Canvas, great tool that you use
to make everything. And so make

999
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:27,150
sure that your models and your
plants are built to a point

1000
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:30,840
where you do have that feature
where you can support that r&d

1001
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,940
And the new product lines off of
what you're

1002
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:36,540
Audrow Nash: growing and keep
building. I see. Yeah. And then

1003
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:36,990
that

1004
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:38,610
Maria Telleria: way, it's under
your control. You're building

1005
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:41,790
what you want to build. And it
should mean that all your

1006
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:45,120
liquidation takes care of itself
possible, right? And

1007
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,250
Audrow Nash: you're basically
aiming at the one that gives you

1008
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:51,300
the most option, in a sense by
being such a compelling business

1009
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:58,230
as opposed to overfitting to one
customer buying you or I don't

1010
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:01,110
know, or I've seen people be
like companies be bought when

1011
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:04,710
they like Miss A funding round
or something like this, this

1012
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:08,910
kind of thing. But if you stay
competitive and keep, keep

1013
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:13,020
growing what you can do and stay
profitable? I mean, that sounds

1014
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,200
fantastic. And then you'll be in
a wonderful situation to like,

1015
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,990
get the best investor and all
this other stuff. That sounds

1016
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:23,760
wonderful. Oh, yeah, shoot for
that. For sure. It's just an

1017
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,190
interesting thing, because it's
a trade off in a sense with

1018
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:29,850
venture capital, as opposed to
so you get to grow quicker, but

1019
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,090
you are on their timeline to
some level, because you they are

1020
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:36,120
expecting some sort of event
where they'll be able to get

1021
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:40,470
their money out for more. And so
just working with that.

1022
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:44,310
Maria Telleria: That's right.
And that continued progress

1023
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:47,550
towards that event. Right. So
like, increasing validation with

1024
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:50,310
ROS No, it's It's definitely,
you know, a decision that you

1025
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:52,890
have to make and look at and for
sure, yeah, like you said,

1026
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:56,220
speed, they definitely have the
what you need. If you want to go

1027
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:59,190
fast, you just gotta make sure
that you can deliver and, and

1028
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,080
you look each other in the eye,
and you're very honest, and

1029
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,360
like, this is what we'll
deliver. We're looking, you

1030
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,940
know, we talked about building
that successful company, what's

1031
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,580
your timeframe? What's the
timeline? Do we all agree that

1032
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:11,190
that's a reasonable timeline,
right? Have they been like, in a

1033
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:11,850
year you have?

1034
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,610
Audrow Nash: A five years, but
we meant to? We want a unicorn

1035
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,660
immediately. Yeah.

1036
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,330
Maria Telleria: And that was
actually that's a perfect one

1037
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:24,660
for us with the expansion,
right. We knew that having been

1038
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,450
in robotics for a while, like,
staying in the Bay Area was the

1039
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,970
best way for us to move really
fast and iterate, right? And we

1040
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,310
knew if we started shipping
these across the country or the

1041
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:35,340
world, we're spreading ourselves
thin. And now you're dealing

1042
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:38,370
with operational problems, as
well as technical problems. So

1043
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:41,820
it's like, iterate here, the
market is big enough here. And

1044
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,340
so we lay that in front of our
investors from the beginning,

1045
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,680
like, Look, we're not going to
be that grow everywhere,

1046
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:51,030
quickly. Nope. Because that one
area Exactly. Nailed it. And

1047
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:53,910
then almost half the customers
be like, Why don't you come over

1048
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:54,150
here?

1049
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,630
Audrow Nash: I'd be wonderful.
Yeah, that funded growth would

1050
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:01,290
be fantastic. When they're like,
We have a big project over here.

1051
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:04,710
We need you over there. It's
like, I don't know, it's

1052
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:06,330
logistically challenging for us.

1053
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:12,150
Maria Telleria: And then we can
support it right, then your

1054
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:15,720
support team is not eight
engineers that have to your

1055
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:19,200
right your time. Yeah, exactly.

1056
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,660
Audrow Nash: I'm always
surprised. companies doing that,

1057
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:23,610
when they're like, we're here
and there. And they're there.

1058
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:26,760
It's like you, there's 10 of
you. It's like how, but

1059
00:57:27,989 --> 00:57:29,999
Maria Telleria: that has been
the approach. I think that a lot

1060
00:57:29,999 --> 00:57:33,389
of firms and venture capital
firms have pushed and for some

1061
00:57:33,419 --> 00:57:36,029
models, I think it makes sense,
right? The first set the market

1062
00:57:36,029 --> 00:57:38,759
is more important than anything.
But once you when do you have

1063
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:42,659
hardware? It'd be that easy.
Yeah. And it's

1064
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,330
Audrow Nash: logistically a lot
of challenge to coordinate. I

1065
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:47,910
mean, you have to like so even
if you're not going to fly one

1066
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:50,910
of your skilled engineers there
when the robot is down for some

1067
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:54,900
reason. It's still like, Okay,
now you need to train a few very

1068
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,710
highly skilled technicians in
the area, and coordinate with

1069
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:02,880
them and give them updates and
all sorts of things. So that

1070
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,420
sounds hard to me. It sounds
like a smart approach to stay

1071
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:11,130
just in the Bay Area. That's a
hell yeah. Let's see. So now the

1072
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:13,380
other really interesting thing
that I was thinking about with

1073
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:18,360
the Segway earlier, you are
working directly with unions

1074
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,700
with your robot, and then just
tell me a bit about that.

1075
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,390
Maria Telleria: Yeah, when we
first started writing, we were

1076
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:27,600
learning about construction and
found drywall finishing. It was

1077
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,940
actually interesting, because we
weren't thinking as roboticists,

1078
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,190
I would hear drywall screenful
We were thinking of being in the

1079
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:34,470
sheets. And it was talking to
construction. People were like,

1080
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:38,550
oh, yeah, that's hard. But let
me tell you. We don't think we

1081
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:41,520
had even thought about that. And
no, it's like this perfect. That

1082
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,910
was it. As we looked at a right
one was look at your market,

1083
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,400
right? And we want to we just
talked about it, we want it to

1084
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,210
be in the Bay Area, state type.
commercial construction is what

1085
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:53,730
makes sense for robotics, right?
Unless you have a pretty big

1086
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:57,060
house, maybe the logistics of
moving the robot might not make

1087
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:00,510
sense instead of the square
footage your house has to do. So

1088
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:03,510
we knew that there was like a
minimum project size that it

1089
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:06,510
makes sense to maneuver a robot.
And so that was like, okay,

1090
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:11,460
commercial area. It's a Union
Market. Right. And I think that

1091
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,470
could maybe upstairs a lot.
People will be like, Alright,

1092
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:17,040
Audrow Nash: here's me. Yeah.
But I also don't

1093
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:21,630
Maria Telleria: know, it's a
little bit of the reputation,

1094
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:23,610
right, like unions are hard to
work with. We just said, Let's

1095
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:25,710
go talk to them. Right? Like,
why assume this thing is I'm

1096
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:28,920
sure they, you know, have heard
things like robots just wanted

1097
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,830
to take your job. So we each
have our own biases. Let's just

1098
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:34,740
stop. And so we reached out to
them and just said that pretty

1099
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,230
much I think we even maybe we
have that prototype with the

1100
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:39,750
cart. It was it was pretty
rough. But we were just like,

1101
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:44,070
hey, we don't have the tool yet.
But we want to invest our time

1102
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:47,460
to develop a tool for your
trade. What do you think? And

1103
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:52,530
kind of like we're like, Yeah,
but they're just like, all the

1104
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:55,230
things we talked about. Like we
can't get new people in the

1105
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:58,230
trade. You know, there's more
work out there that we can do.

1106
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,710
And we're kind of tired of you
You know, all the injuries that

1107
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:04,440
we have and everything. And the
last piece to their product,

1108
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,470
they have recognized that in the
past, they had to post new

1109
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:10,680
technology. And the result had
always been loss of market

1110
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,710
share. So they're like we we
post certain things, we lost

1111
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:17,850
residential. And so there was
also like, that really nice

1112
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:23,700
reflection on there and like,
okay, that's exactly what what

1113
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:27,360
did we oppose, you know, painted
our union to split the drywall

1114
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:30,240
finishing and painting even
those two different traits. And

1115
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,880
so they had lost a lot of the
big market by opposing the

1116
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,090
airless sprayers. And so they
were like, Okay, we learned our

1117
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:39,450
lesson. Let's got it. And then
we, there was also that

1118
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:42,780
seriously being like, we want
you all to be running the

1119
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,660
machine, right? We want the
tapers to be the ones running.

1120
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:49,800
So I think that was also like
where we both were looking at it

1121
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:53,070
as a shared future. And then we
committed when we became a

1122
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:57,630
subcontractor. We said, We'll
sign the union agreement, right,

1123
01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:01,080
we want to work with you all
here in the Bay Area. And so

1124
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,540
they've been great. They've let
us test at their facility, they

1125
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:05,910
have this really cool facility
with all these like doors and

1126
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,980
windows, right? Because they
have to train around them. And

1127
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:12,900
so we bring the robots. So they
just been amazing introduction,

1128
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,140
we run user studies and a user
interface with their members who

1129
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:19,590
maybe never seen the robot says,
hey, if I just showed you this

1130
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:22,410
with you, what would you think
it does? And so they've been

1131
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:26,010
really a great ally in building
this and then supporting it, and

1132
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:27,900
then getting people trained in
using it.

1133
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:36,030
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So with all
the, I guess, the so the union,

1134
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:40,530
their job is to protect the
people who are in this trade.

1135
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:45,150
And so then you're coming to
them. And you're saying, well,

1136
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:49,050
they recognize that the people
are hard to find people are

1137
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:52,860
leaving with injuries, they're
losing share, because maybe

1138
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:55,800
other people are coming in, that
are not people in this union,

1139
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,210
and doing similar jobs. So then
you come and you say, I have

1140
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:02,400
this robot, it's going to make
it a bit easier for your people

1141
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,770
to be efficient, they won't get
as injured. And then now you two

1142
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:10,920
are working there, you and the
Union are working together, you

1143
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:16,140
being canvas. And now then
there's a bunch of mutually

1144
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:18,540
beneficial things that are
occurring that you were saying,

1145
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:21,780
which is like they're helping
with training, they're probably

1146
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,930
helping you understand the
landscape. A good bit better.

1147
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,760
Would you tell me a bit about
that?

1148
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:30,630
Maria Telleria: Yeah, I mean,
the cool thing about the union

1149
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:34,530
is like, all of the people who
do this are on Well, in the

1150
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:38,370
market that we serve are in the
union. So we have to sell to all

1151
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:40,560
the different customers, right?
We don't sell to the Union, we

1152
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,080
sell to the people that employ
them. Yeah. But they have kind

1153
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,810
of like the gather knowledge of
the market, right? They know

1154
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:49,170
which companies busy, we know
which company likes what,

1155
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:52,980
because they have to work with
them on a day to day basis. So

1156
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:56,970
they do have kind of that more,
if you just talk to Yeah,

1157
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:59,640
exactly. What are the customer,
you might get, like, a little

1158
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,770
bit of a bias or something. But
if you talk to the hub that

1159
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:05,130
hears that, you know, these 20
customers? Yeah, exactly. They

1160
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:09,090
can help us. Okay, we're hearing
this helpless translator oh,

1161
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,370
what's happening is blah, blah,
blah, or no, that's customer

1162
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,590
specific. Let me tell you a
story. Right, like the

1163
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:21,600
background like, Ooh, yeah.
Yeah. And then they speak for

1164
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,600
the people right at the end of
the day, because the customers

1165
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,010
is the labor right is not like
their employees that you paid

1166
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:33,630
the union wage. So they also are
better to speak for the people

1167
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:36,900
doing the work than maybe our
direct customers who are more

1168
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:40,320
part of our costs, right? People
are part of our costs, but

1169
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,800
they're not necessarily our
employees. So I think it's also

1170
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,080
good to touch that there.
Because if we just touched our

1171
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:49,500
customers, we might miss
something about the people who

1172
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,750
are doing the work, right.
They're just one step removed

1173
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:52,170
from them.

1174
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:56,400
Audrow Nash: Yeah, that's
clever. It's funny, because it

1175
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,150
sounds like it sounds like it
was initially a hard decision to

1176
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:04,200
decide to go to the union. Like,
it's like, do we just avoid

1177
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,960
them, and then try to do
whatever. And then it turns out

1178
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:12,180
to be this big advantage.
Because they connect you to

1179
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:14,520
everything they kind of let you
in on this. And then it's like,

1180
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:18,450
once you're working with the
union, now everyone in the union

1181
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:20,670
is aware of this great thing
you're doing.

1182
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:25,290
Maria Telleria: Yeah, that's a
very good summary. I'll say the

1183
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:27,810
first decision was stuff. I
think there was a lot of people

1184
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:31,350
advising against it, correct?
I'm sure. I've seen it not play

1185
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:34,740
out well, or different things
are like, hey, maybe go to them

1186
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:37,020
once you're pretty well
established. Right, you know,

1187
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:40,320
negotiation table. And we just
decided to go with the approach

1188
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:44,130
of like, Hey, pretty honest.
This is what we have right now.

1189
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:47,610
It's not great. But we see the
potential. Do you see the

1190
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:51,090
potential and by having that
relationship early to also felt

1191
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:53,130
a little bit like there wasn't
like, they would have heard

1192
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:55,980
about us, right? And they would
have been like this like you're

1193
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:59,970
developing around, versus like,
know when customers can have you

1194
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,400
heard of the trophy? Like, yeah,
we're working with them. We're

1195
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,970
like, oh, so it also helps with
our customers and even their own

1196
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,880
labor force who might be scared
if they heard of this thing

1197
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,730
versus the union telling them,
Hey, this is why we're

1198
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:14,580
supporting it. Let me explain.
So it also helps with those

1199
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,930
misconceptions that you have.

1200
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:20,580
Audrow Nash: That's interesting,
does it? We're so I'm not

1201
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:23,430
terribly knowledgeable about
unions. Is this union, like

1202
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:28,800
local to the bay? Or is it
California wide? Or is it us

1203
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,280
wide or international? Or how
does the union work?

1204
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:37,170
Maria Telleria: Yeah, it's both
right. There's the larger

1205
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:41,310
international national unions
more more national, but they

1206
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:44,820
have kind of their locales, and
they can run independently. So

1207
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:47,460
when we say working with the
union, it's been directly

1208
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:51,870
working with the DC 16 Is that
district council that we work

1209
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:54,480
with directly because they
represent that area. So that

1210
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,570
also made it easy. It was like
this conversation directly with

1211
01:05:57,570 --> 01:06:01,800
each other. There's a larger
union of unions, if we will, but

1212
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:05,040
they all kind of report. They've
been great at saying like, hey,

1213
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:07,620
once you guys are ready, we can
also introduce you to our

1214
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:10,710
friends, right. And I'll say
thanks. But at the same time, we

1215
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:13,080
were in like, Let's not fight
off too much. Let's start by

1216
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:16,440
this your piece of the
agreements, were only with them

1217
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,130
to start with.

1218
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,840
Audrow Nash: And as you were
saying earlier, make it so

1219
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:22,110
they're pulling you over, like
please, please bring your robot

1220
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:26,580
over to us and somewhere else.
Okay, has there has there been

1221
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,800
any challenges working with the
union?

1222
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:34,620
Maria Telleria: Trying to think
I think there's always maybe not

1223
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:37,530
union specific, but just working
with the labor force, right,

1224
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:41,010
that has misconceptions about
recordings? It's always

1225
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:43,680
difficult, right? I think
there's a lot of that, you know,

1226
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,740
why are you here? But no, I
don't think there was anything

1227
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:49,920
specific about the union, right?
The agreements get to be more

1228
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,280
complicated, but lawyers will
understand that. So as an

1229
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,590
engineer, I don't have to figure
out what a collective bargaining

1230
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:59,220
agreement is. Yeah. But that the
details, right could be

1231
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:01,830
overwhelming if you're not used
to. But this is worth getting

1232
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:05,040
people who understand this, what
are their ultimate goals? Let's

1233
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,590
find a way right? Because that
agreement, for example, didn't

1234
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:10,050
have anything about a robotic
tool. So we have to work with

1235
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:14,130
them to make sure that that was
covered. So just that I would

1236
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:17,640
say, that's maybe more work.
That might be the only difficult

1237
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:20,280
but the challenges around the
workforce have been more

1238
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,160
general, rather than like Union
specific, more just the

1239
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,480
misconception. Yeah. So

1240
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:26,520
Audrow Nash: how do you how do
you address those

1241
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:30,240
misconceptions? I guess you can
show them your robot. But any

1242
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:35,340
like, I don't know, stories or
approaches you found that have

1243
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:36,210
been really useful. I

1244
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:40,320
Maria Telleria: think the best
one has been not me telling them

1245
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:43,950
that it's okay. But people like
our team for tapers who have

1246
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:48,600
trained with them, explaining to
them why it's a tool. Why are

1247
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:52,170
two men right? I think there's
something about like, somebody

1248
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:54,540
who's lived your shared
experience, who understands how

1249
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:57,690
tough the work, so I can shout
it from the mountains. Oh, that

1250
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:00,720
sounds interesting. But what do
you know, kind of like, yeah,

1251
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,230
which is fair. And then both.
That's why having again, our

1252
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:07,890
team members are experts be part
of campus, one of the directly

1253
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:10,470
would tell us if we ever, were
not going in the right

1254
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:12,810
direction, right, they could
race it, before we kind of

1255
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:15,960
stepped into it in front of
everybody. They can raise it.

1256
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,720
But then when we go on site,
they're usually the ones that

1257
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:22,110
are most of our direct customer
success in the field is our

1258
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:24,930
field team. Who knows? And so
when they expect, like, Hey,

1259
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:28,470
I've been using it for two plus
years, let me tell you what is

1260
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:31,140
good about it, like, let me tell
you what it's not. Let me tell

1261
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,260
you what parts are why it's
exciting for me to use it. I

1262
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:37,260
think that goes a long way. And
then of course, being able to

1263
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:40,770
say like, look, we're working
with your union, like, you know,

1264
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:43,560
what you've signed on to be kind
of like this agreement of

1265
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,140
working together, making sure
that we're protected. And so

1266
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:48,150
that also helps go along with.

1267
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:52,530
Audrow Nash: Yeah, it's very
interesting. And it's funny to

1268
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:57,570
me, but makes total sense that
they are most except, or people

1269
01:08:57,570 --> 01:09:00,810
are, in general, most except
accepting of something when

1270
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:03,900
someone kind of in the same boat
is like, no, no, this is really

1271
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:08,490
good. As opposed to like, I am a
tech person. And I say this is

1272
01:09:08,490 --> 01:09:12,840
good. It's like someone who also
does this job is like, this is

1273
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:16,350
great. This really makes our
lives easier than they support

1274
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:26,280
it. Let's see. So another so
where do you see yourselves like

1275
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:30,030
where do you see Canvas going?
In the next like five to 10

1276
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:30,600
years?

1277
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:35,160
Maria Telleria: Look, two big
areas, right? One is expansion,

1278
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:38,550
like we will leave the bay area
that's coming sooner rather than

1279
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:41,730
later. Right? We've tested it.
It's been successful on sites.

1280
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,120
Now it's time to go out there.
We have the you know, we have

1281
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,630
our support manuals, we have our
you know, instruction schedules

1282
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:51,510
to feel comfortable that as we
expand, we're not going to be

1283
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:54,810
stretching ourselves. So that's
one of the big areas in Yeah,

1284
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:58,350
five to 10 years right cover the
metropolitan areas in the US

1285
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:01,410
right New York, Atlanta. Hello,
so at least to start, right,

1286
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:04,620
where there's concentrating
building. And then the other

1287
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:08,010
area is on the, like I
mentioned, I want cannabis to be

1288
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:11,280
the tool for other traits as
well. The benefit we can provide

1289
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,760
with drywall finishing, it is a
particularly good trade for it.

1290
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,090
But it's not the only trade and
a lot of the challenges that we

1291
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:22,380
already solved our common right,
we live robot localizing

1292
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:26,430
yourself breaking down the task
into workspaces, all of that are

1293
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:30,720
common to other tasks. So I'm
excited by also starting to look

1294
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:34,290
at those other pieces. And how
do we change the end effector.

1295
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,710
To be able to tackle a different
trade or different types of

1296
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:41,220
Audrow Nash: gotcha, that's
really interesting to you think

1297
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:43,950
about how to use the same
platform, like basically a vase

1298
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:47,130
with an arm. And what tasks is
going to do that makes a lot of

1299
01:10:47,130 --> 01:10:47,580
sense,

1300
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:51,150
Maria Telleria: then you can
start optimizing in two ways,

1301
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:55,290
right? One is like, which task
required the least change. And

1302
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:57,630
that's exciting. But you also
might want to optimize by which

1303
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:01,830
tasks are next to you in the
construction cycle. Because if I

1304
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:04,230
can optimize protests, that
happens right after or right

1305
01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:06,690
before drywall finishing, I
don't have to move my robot

1306
01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:09,630
twice as opposed to maybe one
that's, you know, three months

1307
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:12,150
before drywall finishing. So
there's two ways to optimize I

1308
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:15,060
think, and we look for that
space of like, not too different

1309
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:18,000
technically. But also, hey, I
want to target things

1310
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:20,910
surrounding drywall finishing to
start to get the most use out of

1311
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:22,620
my mobilization costs. Yeah.

1312
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:24,960
Audrow Nash: And if there's any
intersection in those two

1313
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:29,190
optimization problems, then you
could probably do that. And that

1314
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:31,800
might have been what spraying
was after you did, Sandy.

1315
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:38,070
Exactly. Gotcha. What do you So
you mentioned that, how do you

1316
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:41,730
handle the logistics of getting
your robot to the actual

1317
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:42,630
construction site?

1318
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:47,580
Maria Telleria: We, like I
mentioned, we use a mobile base

1319
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:51,000
or started with a very dumb, but
fake your bus to mobile base

1320
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,030
that is using constructor, so
you know, it's a flatbed or just

1321
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:58,470
a truck with a lift gate, and
put it into the machine, drive

1322
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:02,700
it in and out at the site. And
then when we when the sites when

1323
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:05,670
we come in, usually, you know
they're close off, elevators are

1324
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:08,280
in place and everything. So
you're just gonna writing in as

1325
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,460
if they were bringing in another
man lift, as they call them,

1326
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:14,640
right? Just because people need
to realize we haven't talked

1327
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,580
about that. But one of the big
wings of the robot is it can,

1328
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:21,450
you know, lift up to in finish
up to 17 feet. Wow, that avoids

1329
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:24,720
a person having to go up and
down. So it's all based on lift

1330
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:27,480
in that norm that really
constitutes kind of a component.

1331
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:30,780
Cool. And so but these are
common in the sense of people

1332
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:35,070
have to go to the 17 feet to
finish. Yeah, yeah, we move it

1333
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:37,620
very similar like to that they
moved this where you the

1334
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:40,860
operator has the remote control,
they drag it around site, no

1335
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:43,740
autonomy there, we just say,
Hey, this is complicated.

1336
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:47,880
Operator, one to one move the
robot to the site. Yeah, once

1337
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,460
you get into a space, now you
can start talking about some

1338
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:51,000
autonomy.

1339
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:53,340
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Yeah. And
it's quick enough to just have

1340
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:56,820
them drive around. And that's
really nice that it lifts to 17

1341
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:59,430
feet, because I imagine I
imagine now, it's like, you're

1342
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:02,310
hurting your shoulder through
repetitive motion of a heavy

1343
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:05,850
object for eight hours a day.
But also, you're up high. And

1344
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:08,490
I'm sure that there's, as you
get tired, there's more

1345
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:12,120
accidents occurring when people
are like on a ladder, finishing

1346
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:15,480
and you have to like, go down,
move the ladder, or if you're on

1347
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,450
one of those, I guess if they're
on a lift, it's a little bit

1348
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:20,670
different. Like one of those a
little

1349
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:23,970
Maria Telleria: bit. Yeah, they
they'll drive it but in general,

1350
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:28,470
your productivity usually goes
down to half a woman that is

1351
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,200
about eight feet, because up and
down. Because think of the

1352
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,600
material, right? You don't have
all of it. So you're coming up

1353
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,320
and down. And like you said the
the moving and injuries. Yeah,

1354
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,510
there's one of the biggest
sources of accidents in any

1355
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:42,690
construction. Trade is that you
know, the moment you're on a

1356
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:46,110
ladder, and it's hard, right?
People are tasked with, hey,

1357
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:49,470
finish this much by this time of
the day. And so there is also

1358
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:52,230
pressure to run. And so you
start seeing the ladder

1359
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:54,300
scooting, or the you know, the

1360
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,730
Audrow Nash: screws are, like,
hurt, and they bump over when

1361
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:02,280
they're pretty good at it. But
yeah, you shouldn't do it.

1362
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:05,310
That's why I imagined like even
like, if you could walk on it

1363
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:08,040
for a little bit by tilting it
back, that would be horrified.

1364
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:11,520
Maria Telleria: But it is this
pressure right to get the

1365
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:15,750
productivity number sense. I
think it pushes people to, you

1366
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:18,450
know, rush through things. So it
leads to more injuries versus

1367
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:21,090
again, if your tool makes you
more productive. There's other

1368
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:24,450
ways for you to hit those
productivity or get a better

1369
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:28,260
update. Right? Hey, early on,
were this ahead or this much

1370
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:32,010
behind? Let's, you know, let's
plan tomorrow. But even right

1371
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:34,620
now, they have a hard time,
right? Because it's so hard to

1372
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:37,680
track of all the work. So the
work the boss might just be like

1373
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,690
faster, faster, and they're
actually doing really well.

1374
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:44,610
Audrow Nash: Yes, actually, this
goes to something you mentioned

1375
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:48,240
earlier. Reporting. Can you tell
me a bit about how your robot

1376
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:51,210
does reporting on the task at
hand?

1377
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,050
Maria Telleria: Yeah, I think
because we have that map. And we

1378
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:57,810
can correlate back to the work.
We can report you know, the

1379
01:14:57,810 --> 01:15:01,320
square feet finished. And so
that already used to win. But

1380
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,870
the other part is we changed the
process. So we apply all the

1381
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:07,410
with the material in one day and
then sand in another day versus

1382
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:10,530
a manual task right now it's
multiple steps. So if you're the

1383
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:13,500
supervisor, you have to walk
around the site, figure out

1384
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:16,890
overdue in step two or three,
and it's hard to tolerate that.

1385
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,340
Audrow Nash: It looks the same,
basically, exactly.

1386
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:22,620
Maria Telleria: If you're in
three, are you going to achieve

1387
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:25,830
the final quality? And four,
because it's dictated by number

1388
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:27,870
of steps, but the reality is
that they could be charged up,

1389
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:30,510
right? If you're not doing a
good job in step one, you're I

1390
01:15:30,510 --> 01:15:33,660
don't care. You know, if your
step four, you're not done. So

1391
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:37,860
they have a really hard time
tracking, what is the progress

1392
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:40,470
on site, right? So they're just
doing their best to keep up with

1393
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:43,290
the, with all the different
inputs to check everything out

1394
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:46,530
and then calculate versus a
robot intrinsically right? You

1395
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:49,830
ask it to report exactly where
are you in this? Like, I'm 50%

1396
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:52,680
done, or I've done 400 square
feet? Because here's what I do.

1397
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:55,560
Versus if I ask you to report
you'd have to look around you.

1398
01:15:55,620 --> 01:16:00,060
That was a little bit. This was
Yeah, I think I'm 30% done. But

1399
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:00,810
you know, I'm not sure.

1400
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:04,380
Audrow Nash: That's funny. Yeah,
it's nice that you can really

1401
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:07,680
improve that reporting process
make it so much better. Like

1402
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:11,760
you're like, we are 50% done by
square footage. And we have done

1403
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,990
step one and step two, or
something. That's really nice.

1404
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:18,930
Maria Telleria: Yeah, we found
that our customer spent like

1405
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:22,620
four min, which are kind of the
supervisors spent four hours a

1406
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:26,850
week just walking around trying
to figure out what that has

1407
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:30,060
been. Yeah, exactly. That's,
that's a hard process to like,

1408
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,700
and then coordinate with
everybody else around it, versus

1409
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:35,250
I think this is the kind of the
exciting future of construction,

1410
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:37,560
if you have all of these
progress reports, right? That

1411
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,170
optimization is much easier to
say like, oh, well, we need more

1412
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:42,930
painters, because they're
falling behind. Drywall is going

1413
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:45,900
fast enough, like schedule this
and construction schedules could

1414
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:49,260
start reducing versus right now,
because of all the variability,

1415
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:52,830
they have to build a lot of
pillows and nobody wants to get

1416
01:16:52,830 --> 01:16:55,560
rid of those pillows. So you
know, projects take a long time.

1417
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:59,970
Audrow Nash: Yes. Gotcha.
Interesting. Yeah, it would be

1418
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:03,900
nice to make it more efficient,
because of those buffers that

1419
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:06,690
are built in, you can remove
them, because you can have

1420
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:09,390
really accurate reporting where
the robot goes, I know exactly

1421
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:14,430
how far I am. And exactly when
I'll be done. That's really

1422
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:17,670
nice. That'd be really cool,
too. As you guys grow and cover

1423
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:21,780
more and more of the whole
construction space. You can grab

1424
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:24,150
the all of those adjacent things
and make them really efficient.

1425
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:34,320
That'll be super cool. Well,
let's see. So we're coming close

1426
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:39,390
to the end of this, I'd love to
talk about you and your path for

1427
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:44,430
a little bit. Before we end. So
can you just like at a high

1428
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:47,640
level kind of say how you got
involved in robotics, and then

1429
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:51,120
up to your consulting, which
then led you here? We're not not

1430
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,430
necessarily consulting. But you
What are you doing? Taking

1431
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:57,600
government funding? This kind of
thing? How'd you get here?

1432
01:17:58,410 --> 01:18:02,010
Maria Telleria: Yeah, happy to.
So I'm actually my co founder,

1433
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:06,510
Kevin Albert, founded Rotary, a
research company within other

1434
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:11,100
lab, which is really cool lab in
San Francisco that is, you know,

1435
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,890
kind of academic life. But
imagine if the output is not

1436
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:17,070
papers, but spinning out
companies, so they get a lot of

1437
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:20,190
money through research, but take
on these challenges. I look,

1438
01:18:20,190 --> 01:18:22,620
they're just not ready for VC
funding, right? It's just way

1439
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:25,950
too out there. But say, Hey,
this is where research money is

1440
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:28,290
really great. And once you
figure out what company you want

1441
01:18:28,290 --> 01:18:30,960
to build, research, money's not
so great that they spin out into

1442
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:35,520
your thing. But we had John and
I had originally met at MIT. I

1443
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:39,600
was finishing up my PhD, and he
was at Boston Dynamics. And we,

1444
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:42,420
you know, MIT and Boston
Dynamics, we're collaborating on

1445
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:45,390
a project for the government,
research money, we're looking at

1446
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:48,900
making really small robots. So
it's a little bit of a different

1447
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:52,890
space. But the idea of like, Can
the design and the control

1448
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:56,160
approach for the robot itself
allow you to go different

1449
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,860
places, right, so these were
almost thought to be disposable

1450
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:02,010
robots that were really small.
And so we met there, you know,

1451
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:05,070
kind of connected, it was a cool
like, project, because it's so

1452
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:08,700
out there. And, you know, for
us, students getting to work

1453
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:11,040
with Boston Dynamics was also
really cool, right? These are

1454
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,950
awesome. These are big dog he
was working with on that and the

1455
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:16,140
algorithms for that. So it was
like, just such a cool

1456
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:20,790
experience. You know, that. I
graduated, went and worked in

1457
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:24,060
Lincoln Laboratory for a year,
which is I was still really

1458
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:27,390
excited by new technical
challenges. It's a national lab,

1459
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:30,930
right? They get to work on
really cool things, like, design

1460
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:35,280
of telescopes and satellites. I
thought it was really cool. But

1461
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,950
I had a really hard time with
the timeline to my project,

1462
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:40,470
getting to see the time of day,
right it was these are like 10

1463
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:44,400
year plus projects, because you
gotta go through everything to

1464
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,760
get to launch so that they
didn't match as well. But I was

1465
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,580
moving to California and you
know, you start contacting

1466
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:53,070
everybody, probably anybody
who's moved across the country

1467
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:57,390
who can give me a job. It was
funny that somebody was like,

1468
01:19:57,450 --> 01:20:00,000
Oh, do you know this guy? Kevin.
He was, he was like, oh yeah, we

1469
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,390
work together. It's like, well,
he's hiring. He just got a grant

1470
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:07,500
from the government to do these
compliance robots. Why don't you

1471
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,050
connect? So it was like kind of
a fun, like, reconnect and be

1472
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:13,350
like, hey, I want to move out. I
hear you have money. So the

1473
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,350
source kind of the line where
he's got money to hire me.

1474
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:20,430
Audrow Nash: Wow. That's so
funny. You're moving out. I hear

1475
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:24,810
you have money. It's so funny.
Yeah, let's be friends

1476
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:27,900
Maria Telleria: again. It was
yeah, it was just really cool.

1477
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,570
Because, you know, the vision
was there. You know, what, once

1478
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:34,110
he explained what his vision was
of like redesigning robots,

1479
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:37,980
right, not just, from a software
perspective, all the way down to

1480
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:41,280
the hardware, really rethink
robots, such that you approach

1481
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:43,860
the problem of unstructured
environments, right. And he had

1482
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:46,560
come from Boston Dynamics who
did that, but he wanted me to go

1483
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,280
a little bit more into a
solution for industry, right at

1484
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,820
that time, Boston Dynamics was
very research driven still. And

1485
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:57,270
so yeah, it just kind of came
together in, like I said, we did

1486
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:59,970
for two years of like,
discovered research. And then

1487
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:03,120
once we cracked it, we said,
this is it, let's found it. And

1488
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,710
let's, let's make our company
and fundraise. And it was funny.

1489
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:09,930
At the beginning, we thought we
just leased the robots right

1490
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:14,160
away. Or it does make sense. But
it was listening to our

1491
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,550
customers and everything that we
were like, Okay, this will be

1492
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:21,330
less friction. If you hired us
as a service, we can train our

1493
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:23,880
own operators, they can sit next
to the engineer and complain

1494
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:27,780
about everything that went
wrong, right. And so that's what

1495
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:30,960
led us to the self contracting
route, to at least get the

1496
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,420
machines out there and really
make it frictionless for the

1497
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:35,940
customers while the machine was
getting to, you know, from that

1498
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:37,650
prototype to that product stage.

1499
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:41,130
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Awesome.
That's cool to hear your whole

1500
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:44,490
story, how it's kind of come?
Well, I mean, parts of it. It's

1501
01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:49,890
so I don't know, it's cool. I've
been struck recently by how many

1502
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:54,900
companies start by doing like
contracting or whatever, for

1503
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:58,470
government related research, or
they start doing government

1504
01:21:58,470 --> 01:22:02,550
research. And then that's like,
solving a lot of the problems,

1505
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:05,760
kind of as you were mentioning
earlier, and then once you find,

1506
01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:09,060
like, Okay, this problem can be
solved by robots, then you can

1507
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:14,370
jump out and do a company around
this. So that was the compliance

1508
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:19,050
where Kevin was doing this was
did it? Was it this idea of

1509
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:24,240
Canvas and dry wall robot? Or
was it just general, and then

1510
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,410
you found this application?

1511
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:28,800
Maria Telleria: It was more
general, it was really thinking

1512
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,500
about compliance. And we had
gotten down to the level where

1513
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:34,650
like, everything was, you know,
air driven. So like, the robot

1514
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:38,130
was super compliant, which was
great for like, you know, we

1515
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:41,010
were especially underwater, we
were actually hydraulic driven,

1516
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:44,250
but you were super compliant.
You could sounds like a really

1517
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:48,120
cool approach, but had a lot of
technical challenges for us as

1518
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:52,200
we started solving. Exactly.
Some of them. It was also

1519
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,120
looking at each other and be
like, Okay, we found the

1520
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:57,480
application, what do we really
need our research, and that's

1521
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:00,030
where it was like, okay, more
about the compliance at the end,

1522
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:02,160
effector, you know, your whole
arm doesn't have to be

1523
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:05,910
inflatable, for compliance to be
there. So we also have to leave

1524
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:09,060
a lot of our research ideas
behind because they were more

1525
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:11,670
research than they were
solutions, or

1526
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,720
Audrow Nash: what was so what
were some of the challenges. I

1527
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:19,890
don't know about? I guess I
don't know too much about your

1528
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:23,820
past with this. But it sounds
like coming from academia to now

1529
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:27,000
being in the startup, what have
been some of the challenges for

1530
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:27,330
you?

1531
01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:32,370
Maria Telleria: Oh, I think the
biggest challenge was maybe the

1532
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:36,420
mindset shift, right? I lost a
lot of academia, but also, they

1533
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:40,170
didn't want to be in academia.
So Lincoln Lab was kind of these

1534
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:43,500
happy middle steps, right?
Because you were still Yeah, so

1535
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:46,650
I kind of baby stepped into the
world outside of academia

1536
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:51,270
Audrow Nash: seems like most
into the real world that you can

1537
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:55,140
be to me, because it's entirely
merit driven for this kind of

1538
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:58,050
thing. And can you actually
provide value? So it's, I don't

1539
01:23:58,050 --> 01:23:59,910
know, you're saying baby steps,
but then it's like to the

1540
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,350
bleeding edge kind of thing.

1541
01:24:02,850 --> 01:24:04,710
Maria Telleria: Yeah, there were
big, big show. No, you're right.

1542
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:06,660
I think the first two were baby.
And then it was like,

1543
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:09,750
Audrow Nash: Yeah, for sure.

1544
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:14,610
Maria Telleria: It was probably
the excitement was always like,

1545
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:18,330
building something new, or, you
know, designing something new

1546
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:21,030
and different. You know, there's
a lot of ingenuity that's

1547
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:25,080
optimizing and getting a better
cost or precision, but I was a

1548
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:28,590
little more driven by, I want to
create something new. And so

1549
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:32,340
that was kind of the thread
between academia. But then also

1550
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:35,730
being like, you had to make sure
that you were okay, letting go

1551
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:40,110
of those things. Right. And I
think that was yeah, that was a

1552
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:43,140
real test that we were ready for
that lunch was like, can you

1553
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:46,650
guys leave behind the things you
don't really? Right? I think

1554
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:49,560
some people can't. And that's
hard, where you develop with

1555
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:52,050
research and then you find this
perfect opportunity. But then

1556
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,440
you take that same research
solution and try to apply it to

1557
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,950
the real world and it starts
breaking on your academia rights

1558
01:24:58,950 --> 01:25:01,230
and things like that. Got you
up. Paper doesn't mean it's

1559
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:05,130
gonna get you anything else.
Anything else? So I think that

1560
01:25:05,130 --> 01:25:08,130
was a good test for us. Like, if
we were ready for the launch was

1561
01:25:08,130 --> 01:25:11,220
like, Ooh, we really need this
arm that we've been working on

1562
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:15,690
for, you know, Blood Sweat Tears
around and we were like, No, we

1563
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:18,540
don't, we can move it to this
and you know, buy an off the

1564
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:20,730
shelf. It was the time to do it.

1565
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:22,650
Audrow Nash: That's so
interesting. It's so interesting

1566
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:26,670
to hear that it was like a
process of letting go. Because

1567
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:30,210
you can't carry all this stuff
with you. And so you have to so

1568
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:32,820
that you can move forward.
That's so interesting. It's cool

1569
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:35,610
to me how that's like a
psychological shift was

1570
01:25:35,610 --> 01:25:39,540
required. It's kind of thing.
Yeah. I would have never thought

1571
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:44,100
of that. That makes total sense,
though. Very interesting. And so

1572
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:49,680
coming from academia, kind of
getting into this and actually

1573
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:53,700
being, I guess, what is your
experience been? Like? How have

1574
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:58,440
you been thinking of this whole
startup time? I don't know. What

1575
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:59,550
are your impressions so far?

1576
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:04,950
Maria Telleria: It's, it's
awesome. But it's hard to like,

1577
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:07,920
tell people were like, I want to
join a startup. Which one? Like,

1578
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:12,540
I don't know, a startup on? What
are we doing? Just? Yeah, I just

1579
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:17,040
started just for the road. I
think for me, it was more like,

1580
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:20,430
I want to do this, the way to do
it is to do a startup, right? It

1581
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:23,520
was more like the venue to do
it. And so then it was really

1582
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,310
cool. I want to be in a company
that solving this problem,

1583
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:28,650
everything okay, then you have
to build it right. As opposed

1584
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:31,860
to, I just want to go through
the because it does have its

1585
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:35,220
hard parts, right. I think it's
it's also interesting,

1586
01:26:35,310 --> 01:26:38,040
especially coming from very
technical background, both of us

1587
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:41,220
like, at one point, you really
say most of our problems are not

1588
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:45,810
technical. We get jealous when
the other one gets to do a

1589
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:50,190
little bit of technical work.
Like, how do you hire people,

1590
01:26:50,190 --> 01:26:53,610
right? People have concerns that
you have to address, how do you

1591
01:26:53,610 --> 01:26:57,000
build a company that has good
values? And as things get tough,

1592
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,900
you stand by those values,
right? And so those kind of

1593
01:27:00,930 --> 01:27:03,270
challenges, like you're not
thinking when you first pick it

1594
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:05,700
right? You're like, how are we
going to solve it technically.

1595
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:08,610
But as you've kind of grow,
those become some of the work

1596
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:11,610
that you really have to do. And
I think there it has to be that

1597
01:27:11,610 --> 01:27:13,920
you have to be excited about
building company, because

1598
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:17,880
otherwise, it'll just feel like
wearing down like I just want to

1599
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:20,370
do and at that point, you might
say like, Hey, let's bring in

1600
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:23,220
somebody to do the company
management. And I'll just do the

1601
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:27,060
technical work. But we both kind
of really liked also the idea of

1602
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:30,450
like forming a company that are
excited to go into everyday. So

1603
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:33,180
that's why we got neck state in
those positions. Yeah,

1604
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:36,840
Audrow Nash: I really like this
how it seems. So I mean, to me,

1605
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:39,960
it seems like often the best
robotics companies are ones that

1606
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,960
didn't decide to use robotics,
because like they weren't like

1607
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,540
at the beginning, I'm going to
use robotics, they were like,

1608
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:49,170
oh, robotics happens to be the
best way to solve this problem.

1609
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,260
And for you with this company,
it seems like an analogous thing

1610
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:55,470
where it's, I don't really want
to do a startup. But it seems

1611
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:58,920
like the best way to make this
change that I would like to

1612
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:01,950
make. I think that's really
cool. It's not and then it

1613
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:06,060
sounds like also, as opposed to
the viewpoint of I just want to

1614
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:12,060
be in a startup. It's it's a
very pragmatic choice. And you

1615
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:16,530
are sustained by like, a larger
mission, which is to make this

1616
01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:19,920
change to kind of help this area
as opposed to I just want to be

1617
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,590
in a startup for that startup
sake, it doesn't, I have no

1618
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:24,690
greater mission for it, I
probably just want to be rich

1619
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:28,980
one day, or whatever it is that
I think of startups for this

1620
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:29,250
kind of

1621
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:31,140
Maria Telleria: thing. Some
people have this idea of like

1622
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:33,990
the payout is going to be great,
or I'll get great experience.

1623
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:36,780
And that is a really good
target. Because you get the

1624
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:42,090
Yeah, for me, it's definitely
more like, okay, I get to build

1625
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:45,570
this I get to put into center,
right. It's like if something is

1626
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:49,500
not the way I want it to be like
it's up to me go change it,

1627
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:52,320
right. Make the company that you
want. So I think that gets me

1628
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:55,140
through the days that are not
Assisi, Korea, and also through

1629
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:58,800
the high skips you grounded,
right? Yes. This is like, oh,

1630
01:28:59,490 --> 01:29:03,210
oh, so much responsibility. To
do it, right.

1631
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:07,050
Audrow Nash: Oh, for sure. Have
you? So in your experience

1632
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:11,340
consulting or in academia? Did
you ever lead teams? For this?

1633
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:13,830
Like, did you ever lead large
groups of people? Because it

1634
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:17,190
sounds like you're very involved
in this now. And how has that

1635
01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:17,850
been for you?

1636
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:22,170
Maria Telleria: I learned a
little bit even from in grad

1637
01:29:22,170 --> 01:29:24,840
school, I always enjoyed kind of
the mentoring side. So

1638
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:29,280
undergraduates, you know, one or
two, yeah, one or two people.

1639
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,670
And it's a little different,
right? Because it's it's smaller

1640
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:35,580
scale, you can spend the time so
I knew I had enjoyed that I'd

1641
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:38,640
done like, the, you know, class
projects and been kind of the

1642
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:42,180
lead. So I was happy to go that
route, right. Like, I was like,

1643
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:44,790
I want to make this versus other
people very quickly. Like, I'm

1644
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:48,270
an IC. I'm great at it. Right?
But that's, that's what I want

1645
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:50,910
to do. And you know, if you come
in with that self awareness,

1646
01:29:50,910 --> 01:29:53,250
it's always a lot easier as a
founding team, right? If

1647
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:57,150
everybody knows, but once I
started another lab with Kevin

1648
01:29:57,150 --> 01:30:00,300
Right, it was like, thinking
myself and another person To

1649
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:02,310
start, and then we started
growing, we needed more

1650
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:06,150
engineers. And you know, he was
CEO. So he was running kind of

1651
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:08,910
the sport. And I just kind of
said to him like, Hey, you cool

1652
01:30:08,910 --> 01:30:11,670
if I start managing this group,
right? It's, you're starting to

1653
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:17,760
get a little bit late and things
like that. Yep. Of course, yeah.

1654
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:21,150
This gradual, and I got to grow
with it, right? Because at first

1655
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:23,910
it was like, three, report, and
then five, and then 20. And then

1656
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:26,700
you're just like, Oh, so you're
just like, okay, it all cut out?

1657
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,610
I love me the time to grow with
it. I imagine some other

1658
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:33,330
companies have these humongous
steps. And Oh, totally, you just

1659
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:36,930
roll with it? Yeah, so far, it's
allowed me to grow it. And then

1660
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,750
the other piece of thing, like,
what areas are you weak on, get

1661
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:43,020
somebody, you know, just be very
self aware throughout the whole

1662
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:45,270
journey, because otherwise,
you'll just kind of bounce, you

1663
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:47,670
know, hit your head against the
wall and be frustrated when

1664
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:52,350
you're just gonna enjoy this.
Or, and or, I'm not that good at

1665
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:56,670
this, either get training, get a
coach, but also probably get

1666
01:30:56,670 --> 01:30:58,530
somebody within the company to
help you with that.

1667
01:30:59,910 --> 01:31:03,150
Audrow Nash: For sure, yeah, I
think being really realistic.

1668
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:06,030
And being like, I'm good at
this, I'm not good at this, and

1669
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:09,060
US addressing whatever it is,
like I'm good at this, I'm gonna

1670
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:12,120
do more of that. I'm not good at
this, I'm gonna hire that out.

1671
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:15,180
These kinds of things that I
don't know, a very deep

1672
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:17,730
connection to reality seems like
a really important thing to

1673
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,770
startups success, in my opinion.

1674
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:21,570
Maria Telleria: 100%

1675
01:31:22,979 --> 01:31:28,139
Audrow Nash: What would you so
advice for like, a 20 year old

1676
01:31:28,139 --> 01:31:31,619
you? Or something like this?
Like? What, uh, what advice

1677
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:34,949
would you give to someone who's
like 20? Now, just starting

1678
01:31:34,949 --> 01:31:37,109
school, or in the middle of
school?

1679
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:40,829
Maria Telleria: Yeah. From the
technical side, I would say

1680
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:45,839
like, explore outside of your
domain, right? Your politics in

1681
01:31:45,839 --> 01:31:48,689
particular requires that cross
domain. But I think in general,

1682
01:31:48,689 --> 01:31:52,889
we're just seeing more and more
like jobs blending, right? I

1683
01:31:52,889 --> 01:31:55,799
don't think there's as there are
very few people who do one only

1684
01:31:55,799 --> 01:31:59,759
one thing, right. And so I would
say explore, really, even if

1685
01:31:59,759 --> 01:32:02,579
you're a mechanical engineer,
take some software classes, or

1686
01:32:02,579 --> 01:32:05,549
even sit in on those, like, get
yourself in there, do some

1687
01:32:05,549 --> 01:32:09,209
projects that maybe expose you
to that. And then that'd be the

1688
01:32:09,209 --> 01:32:12,809
other side of like, I was lucky.
And it just interested in

1689
01:32:12,809 --> 01:32:15,449
business, right, taking some
business classes at MIT and

1690
01:32:15,479 --> 01:32:18,209
participate in some of the
Entrepreneurship Center work.

1691
01:32:18,689 --> 01:32:21,119
But that exposed me to it. So I
think for people who are

1692
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:23,729
thinking like, maybe I want to
do a startup, there's a lot of

1693
01:32:23,729 --> 01:32:26,759
opportunities to dip your toes
while in college and doing like,

1694
01:32:26,819 --> 01:32:29,039
you know, learning about
business plans and stuff like

1695
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:32,759
that. And just kind of see back
to that really sick. Like, maybe

1696
01:32:32,759 --> 01:32:34,649
that's not for you, you know,
you might be really happy in a

1697
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:38,039
big company, or something or you
know, a big national lab doing

1698
01:32:38,039 --> 01:32:41,789
just research or academia, but
kind of go out there and test it

1699
01:32:41,789 --> 01:32:43,829
out, rather than I think
sometimes you don't you didn't

1700
01:32:43,829 --> 01:32:45,689
like to hear the latest thing,
and that's what you're going to

1701
01:32:45,689 --> 01:32:50,039
do. I'm not going to be a
founder, I don't know what that

1702
01:32:50,039 --> 01:32:55,469
means. A lot about experience
using that time in school, it is

1703
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:57,959
about getting the grade, but
it's also about like, what

1704
01:32:57,959 --> 01:33:00,749
awesome opportunity for your
students experience, like the

1705
01:33:00,899 --> 01:33:03,419
lectures that you get to go to
right that you're just never

1706
01:33:03,419 --> 01:33:06,719
gonna have the time to do that
kind of exploration, like do it

1707
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:10,049
then and it's true. Get to know
really who you are back to that

1708
01:33:10,049 --> 01:33:13,229
self awareness, the more you
discovered, then the less 30

1709
01:33:13,229 --> 01:33:17,039
It's a lot harder to be picky.
You're self aware, for sure.

1710
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:20,820
Audrow Nash: With all the life
things that come up. Yeah, for

1711
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:26,430
sure. Okay, awesome. Where do
you so if you look out like two

1712
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:29,400
and five years, where do you
think robotics is gonna go?

1713
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:33,900
Maria Telleria: Definitely think
that there's gonna be a huge

1714
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:38,940
growth in other markets, if you
will, or other areas, right? I

1715
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:42,840
think logistics and
manufacturing, logistics and

1716
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:47,550
manufacturing will continue to
kind of increase. But to some

1717
01:33:47,550 --> 01:33:50,160
point, we're getting to like the
optimization problem, rather

1718
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:53,040
than the adoption problem. And I
just think areas like

1719
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:57,180
construction, but there's so
many other ones are really need

1720
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:59,910
that kind of productivity game,
we always look at that plot, if

1721
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:02,010
you plot like manufacturing,
productivity versus

1722
01:34:02,010 --> 01:34:05,250
construction, manufacturing,
like 300% infrastructure and

1723
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:08,370
decrease so we've actually
gotten less productive over

1724
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:08,700
time.

1725
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:10,560
Audrow Nash: And it's regulation
that just isn't it.

1726
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:15,840
Maria Telleria: I think it's
Yeah, regulation. Just exactly

1727
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:19,110
like your regulation, and then
don't give people new tools. So

1728
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:21,900
you say I'm gonna make it a
little harder, you know, reboot,

1729
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:24,210
people use these stills, for
example, to finish the line.

1730
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:27,810
That's not very safe. I'm gonna
remove that. But you still have

1731
01:34:27,810 --> 01:34:30,990
the same tools. What's gonna
happen, right, or even the

1732
01:34:30,990 --> 01:34:33,660
designs got more interesting
people, architects got real

1733
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:37,590
designs, but you still have the
same tool from 50 years ago.

1734
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:40,680
Something has to give in product
and base what's given and so for

1735
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:43,950
me, I really see robotics,
especially with the sensing

1736
01:34:43,950 --> 01:34:48,180
technology that we've gotten in
the computational power, but

1737
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:50,400
also the approach of people
started approaching them

1738
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,560
differently, right, more than
the Cobots more the

1739
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:56,190
augmentation, you start opening
up the idea of like, okay, maybe

1740
01:34:56,190 --> 01:35:01,140
a robot is not a fixed equipment
but a tool I just see that

1741
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:04,980
really exploding. And people
really being able to protect

1742
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:08,340
their bodies more by having
access to these tools that all

1743
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:10,890
of these kind of things are
coming together at this time. So

1744
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:13,440
I don't think it'll be just
construction construction will

1745
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:16,320
be one of the big ones, but some
of the other spaces will also

1746
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,280
get really interesting.

1747
01:35:17,759 --> 01:35:21,629
Audrow Nash: Awesome. Do you
have any links or contact info

1748
01:35:21,629 --> 01:35:23,519
you'd like to share with our
listeners and watchers?

1749
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:27,000
Maria Telleria: Yeah, we always
encourage people to go to our

1750
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,530
website at Campus dot build in
Yeah, you can reach out to over

1751
01:35:31,530 --> 01:35:34,980
you know, LinkedIn or over
email. It's just Maria Canvas

1752
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:38,490
dot build. But we're always
excited. We also have an

1753
01:35:38,490 --> 01:35:42,390
Instagram that got to post a lot
of pictures on site. And I like

1754
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:45,780
because you get to see the
reality right of like, what it's

1755
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:47,880
like, you can see those nice
pictures where everything's

1756
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:50,370
clean and the robots there. It's
beautiful. And then you see the

1757
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:52,740
ones where there's buckets
everywhere that you go around,

1758
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:54,870
and you're just like, oh, that's
why it's hard to be in an

1759
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:56,190
unstructured environment. Yeah,

1760
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:59,760
Audrow Nash: for sure. Oh,
that's so funny. All right. Hell

1761
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,160
yeah. Well, this was a blast.
Thank you, Maria.

1762
01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:05,220
Maria Telleria: Thank you so
much. It was fun to get to talk

1763
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:07,260
to you. Awesome. Bye, everyone.

1764
01:36:13,979 --> 01:36:16,199
Audrow Nash: I hope you enjoyed
my conversation with Maria

1765
01:36:16,199 --> 01:36:20,309
Delaria. Thank you again to our
founding sponsor, open robotics.

1766
01:36:20,459 --> 01:36:21,359
See you next time.
