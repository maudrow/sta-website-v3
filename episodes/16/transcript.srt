1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,070
Audrow Nash: This is a
conversation with Helen Greiner,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,600
who is the CEO of Tertill. Tertill
makes a solar powered robot

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,920
wieder for home vegetable
gardens. And you see this Tertill

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,820
robot, you might think of the
robot vacuum cleaner the Roomba

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,260
by iRobot. This comparison makes
sense. And funny enough, they

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,710
were both made by some of the
same people, Helen included.

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,490
What I think is beautiful about
the Roomba, and this robot the

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,170
Tertill is that it is so
relatively simple, yet provides

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,190
real value. Vacuuming under the
bed is a pain. And I don't have

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,940
much experience with weeding,
but weeding sounds awful. And

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,410
both of these products are for
the consumer market, meaning

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,410
that they have to be inexpensive
enough that many people can

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,820
afford them. The iRobot Roomba
was one of the first successful

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,620
consumer robots, and it grew the
consumer robotics space, which

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,030
benefited all of us in robotics,
from making investment easier to

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,350
come by to parts being cheaper
to showing people that robots

17
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,820
aren't all Terminator robots. As
Helen says before this

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,870
interview, and has been said
before on this podcast, a rising

19
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,400
tide lifts all boats. I look
forward to seeing how the Tertill

20
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,850
does in the future. And if I
start a garden, I'll probably

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,340
get one. I'm Audrow Nash. This
is the sense think act podcast.

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,940

please consider subscribing. A

23
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,960
big thank you to our founding
sponsor open robotics. And now,

24
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,630
here's my interview with Helen
Greiner. Would you introduce

25
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,220
yourself? Hi, I'm

26
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,330
Helen Greiner: Helen gainer. And
I'm a robot enthusiast.

27
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,069
Audrow Nash: Now, we're gonna be
talking mostly about Tertill. But

28
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:57,719
I'd love to start, like for
context to talk about your whole

29
00:01:57,989 --> 00:01:59,279
path in robotics.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,970
Helen Greiner: Oh, that's a long
way. A long time.

31
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:06,779
Audrow Nash: You want to just
tell me like, I mean, maybe at a

32
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:09,149
high level from grad school, and
then you were involved with

33
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:09,989
iRobot?

34
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,760
Helen Greiner: Well, it started
back when I was 11. And I saw

35
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,130
Star Wars and fell in love with
auto detail and odd to think,

36
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:26,310
you know, he wasn't just a
machine, right? He was a

37
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,080
character. He had an agenda. He
saved the universe. He had a

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,610
personality, a lot of expression
with his bleeps and bloops. And,

39
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,730
you know, since that time, I've
always wanted to make things

40
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,510
that are more than machines. And
so I went to MIT to learn how.

41
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,400
And it turns out, I learned a
lot of great engineering there,

42
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,540
but they didn't really know how
to build robots for the real

43
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:58,050
world. And so right after grad
school, I was in grad school at

44
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,280
MIT, in computer science,
although my undergraduates

45
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,500
mechanical and accepted to the
Ph. D. program, but instead

46
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,270
decided to cofound iRobot
corporation with vide books and

47
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,080
Cullen angle.

48
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,030
Audrow Nash: And then, so you
will What did you do at iRobot?

49
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,220
So you were designing the robot
I believe. Original vacuum

50
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,030
cleaner robots.

51
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,000
Helen Greiner: Now, way back
when way back when, when the

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,040
company first found it. All of
us myself lied and con, we're

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,000
actually designing the robots
and building them and

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,520
fabricating them and everything
about the robots. But though,

55
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:50,580
you know, we started iRobot in
1990. It wasn't until, like, 98,

56
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,000
we started seriously working on
the Roomba and not until 2002.

57
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,200
We put it on the market. So
there's a lot of history before

58
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,610
that. Oh, we are, you know, the
longest overnight success.

59
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,810
People hadn't heard about us
until the bomba. But you know,

60
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,020
there's a whole lot of robots
that we were building. Before

61
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,310
eventually military

62
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,760
Audrow Nash: in nature. It was
like we did we did

63
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,370
Helen Greiner: robots for so
many different industries. We

64
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:23,580
did a robot for oil and gas
industry doing downhole

65
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,420
inspections, plug patch
perforate stuff. We had robots

66
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,890
that large cleaning robots, we
had robots that were in a museum

67
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,240
that was robots that we sold to
research labs. We get a toy

68
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,610
robot, a baby doll robot with
Hasbro. Just so many different

69
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:51,870
robots. But it wasn't until we
put robots on the market under

70
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,230
our brand that we were you know
that we had any success.

71
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,460
Audrow Nash: Interesting. So it
was was it kind of like you were

72
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,310
contracts Acting around like
people would want robots or

73
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,630
you'd see it opportunities.

74
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,700
Helen Greiner: Yeah, it was it
was kind of like any robot for

75
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,320
money usually would get the
large company to bring the

76
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,340
dollars. And you know, we, I, we
believe the marketing and the

77
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,510
the market savvy, and we were
doing the technology and the

78
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:26,940
creativity and the innovation
and the robots. And you know, it

79
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,940
sounds good on paper. But what
usually happened was the

80
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,910
industries work at glacial
paces. And the person who was

81
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:41,490
advocate either move to another
position or another company, and

82
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,670
then you almost had to start the
sales pitch, again, from the or

83
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,380
from the beginning. Yeah. So I
don't think we had enough top

84
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,240
level buy in at the companies to
make it successful. And in some

85
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,890
cases, the robot technology was
competing with the status quo of

86
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:03,120
how the the existing product
lines. So you know, a larger

87
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,590
company wouldn't have that much
incentive to, you know, push it

88
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,130
forward.

89
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,969
Audrow Nash: Interesting. And
then how did it how did you go

90
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:14,279
towards the Roomba with us

91
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,660
Helen Greiner: like? Well, let's
see, our first employee at

92
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:25,290
iRobot was Joe Jones, Joe had
been thinking about some of the

93
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,640
things while he was at MIT, and
that Maxwell was wide Brooks's

94
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,600
behavioral control algorithms,
because, you know, we really

95
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,480
didn't have a lot of resources
to put on these smaller robots.

96
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,640
So we couldn't have, you know,
the kinds of processing and the

97
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,480
kinds of capabilities that some
of the robots have today, even

98
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:56,850
the Roomba. So, Joe wrote a
white paper in I think, you

99
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,640
know, maybe 9097, or 98, saying,
you know, hey, we're building

100
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,160
these large cleaning lots, we're
building all these larger

101
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,760
robots. But really, we should do
the simplest possible thing

102
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,850
first, and he spelled out,
small, low bought five point

103
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:21,360
about $200. Needs to be fully
automated use the simplest

104
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,620
possible senses rather than, you
know, the most capable senses.

105
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,050
And, you know, get something out
there pretty quickly. And we,

106
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,830
you know, it sounded like a good
idea to everybody. So it was

107
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,710
funded with very small amounts
of money, because we didn't have

108
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,700
a lot of money. And, you know,
it kept building prototypes of

109
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:49,110
it, Joe and the team, and they,
you know, got, you know, we

110
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,620
could never see a reason why it
wouldn't work. And we fully

111
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,850
expected when we started it to
see a reason why there's one

112
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:03,660
component missing, like, it's
not a product. Yep. There was

113
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,050
another robot vacuum. On the
market. We didn't know that much

114
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,320
about it at the time, I left on
that Sandborn, but it was many

115
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,940
1000s of dollars. Us, it doesn't
sound very high tech today, but

116
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,830
use Sona technology, but it made
it very expensive. And I think

117
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,640
that when a new concept is new,
it has to be reasonably

118
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,950
inexpensive for people to take
that jump. So Moonves might sell

119
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,790
sometimes for, you know, $1,000
today, but when you're a new

120
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:37,500
company, with a new band in a
very new area, it's important

121
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,530
that it's, you know, it's a kind
of product, you can take your

122
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,400
wallet out and say, Oh, I'll
take a risk on that.

123
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,190
Audrow Nash: Yeah, definitely.
And there's a lot of people that

124
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,670
are willing to do that, because
maybe they're way less that are

125
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,640
willing to take the risk and
like $1,000, robot vacuum

126
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,160
cleaner versus a $200. One.
Okay, and then where

127
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,890
Helen Greiner: we got, we got
the robot on the market, the,

128
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,800
the Roomba, we still doing the
robots for the military. And

129
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,720
that actually, we got them both
on the market in 2002. The

130
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,640
robots in the military got moved
up because of the war efforts

131
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,820
and Operation Enduring Freedom
in Afghanistan, and then soon

132
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,570
after evac, they probably would
have stayed as military research

133
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,530
for a while. But there was this
Driving driving need for bomb

134
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,950
disposal robots, and we were
like, they're with the

135
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,570
capability that they needed. And
at the same time, we put the

136
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:42,090
limbo on the market and you
know, starting to get some

137
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,760
consumer success. And so these
companies never would have had

138
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,270
these two disparate areas if one
had happened first, right,

139
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,360
because all the resources would
have been thrown at that one,

140
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,980
just because they were
successful together. And you

141
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,060
know, it really helped us
because I can tell you a lot of

142
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,750
the investors didn't believe in
the consumer robot market until

143
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,330
we had it on the market. And it
was successful.

144
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,880
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So that the
investors were or was it like

145
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,480
you were funding the efforts
with the military robots. And

146
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,640
that allowed you to bootstrap
the concern?

147
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,040
Helen Greiner: We were we were
paying for infrastructure with

148
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,800
the military contracts, because
we have large contracts as

149
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,080
research contracts as well as
having built up, you know, so

150
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,600
the infrastructure was being
paid for, like, you know, the

151
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,350
offices and that we had people
on staff to a very capable

152
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,340
roboticist because we had the
ability to pay for them. But we

153
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,000
didn't really raise investment
capital until eight years in in

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,770
1998. That's when we started.
And by 2005, when we took it

155
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:57,030
public, it you know, we'd raised
a total of 38 million, which is

156
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,150
peanuts today, that's like
seeing these, you know, a OB

157
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,600
today.

158
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,610
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Okay. And
then you raise the capital, and

159
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,550
then that lets you scale so you
could grow the consumer market

160
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,730
for the room, or the consumer
side of the business for the

161
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:11,940
room.

162
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,490
Helen Greiner: At the same time,
though, you know, after we went

163
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,930
public, the military side was
going strong too. But

164
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:24,750
eventually, after I left in
2008, they did spend the

165
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,860
military stuff out into a
company called andeavor, which

166
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,570
was purchased by FLIR for like
over $300 million. And then,

167
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,380
that was purchased actually was
all purchased by Teledyne. So

168
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,260
the technology still exists, the
robots don't exist, a lot of the

169
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,840
same people are working on them,
but it's no longer a robot.

170
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:49,080
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. What is
your so between 1998 and 2008?

171
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,300
Or so when you left? iRobot?
What were you primarily involved

172
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,100
Helen Greiner: in? Everything I
was, you know, going on time, I

173
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:06,030
was president chairman, and, you
know, everything from sales to

174
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:12,060
media to taking it public and
investment. Acquisitions as you

175
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,810
know, everything.

176
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:18,090
Audrow Nash: Mm hmm. And then
how did you decide to go to sci

177
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,710
fi work? So that was the next
step? Right.

178
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,480
Helen Greiner: Yeah. Well, I was
looking at what next? And, you

179
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,290
know, being chairman of a
company is kind of the best job

180
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:33,000
actually, what it really is,
because it's a gotcha what I was

181
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,660
at Iowa, but because you have,
you know, you get to do a lot of

182
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,730
interesting things. But you're
not, you know, you don't have

183
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,660
all that operational
responsibility. But it's not the

184
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,980
best job when you're 40 years
old, which is what I was. So I

185
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,280
think that I really, when I
looked at what I really liked, I

186
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,490
liked it when the Roomba and
pack bought the military robots,

187
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,920
were first being developed the
innovation side when you're

188
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,710
getting something the likes of
which people haven't seen

189
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,760
before, after. And so that's why
I want to do it again. And I saw

190
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,310
that the drone space was the
place to do it. And

191
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:12,479
Audrow Nash: how did you see it
was the space to do it? And what

192
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:12,779
made

193
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,080
Helen Greiner: it was an
untapped market. You know, when

194
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,200
I look at drones, it's like, a
magic technology that solves a

195
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,730
lot of the problem. You know, I
think it will guild guild fat

196
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,930
who was adopted now at Toyota
research, I think he he's the

197
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,410
one who first said, The problem
with ground robots is to ground

198
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,090
all this stuff on the ground,
right? Especially when you take

199
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,840
it out outdoors, and even
indoors with the Roomba. You

200
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,280
know, there's a lot of pollen
you have to face and a lot of

201
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,580
recognition, you know, a lot of
knowing what it is and getting

202
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,090
around it. And negotiation was a
drone, you could just fly right

203
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,420
over it. Right? And you know,
free space is actually easy.

204
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,530
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Okay, so you
saw that there was potential

205
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,740
here because it solves a lot of
existing robotics challenges. So

206
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,860
you could probably do new and
interesting things. But then how

207
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,900
sci fi works? And actually,
would you kind of speak to the

208
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,010
premise of the company?

209
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:12,599
Helen Greiner: Well, the Sci Fi
works. The idea we had

210
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:15,839
originally was at the time, a
little less so now, but at the

211
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,229
time, the battery technology
wasn't there. So the drones

212
00:14:19,229 --> 00:14:23,039
would only run a short amount of
time and not enough any real

213
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:28,559
types of military missions or
law enforcement missions. So or

214
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,759
even, you know, long term
communication missions. So we

215
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:37,079
had some technology to make a
tethered drone. And we were, you

216
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,589
know, the first ones out there
with a drone that you could stay

217
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:44,369
stays up in the air for, you
know, weeks at a time. So you

218
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:47,849
put it up on a tether, and you
put it up to you know, put it up

219
00:14:47,849 --> 00:14:51,419
to 300 feet in the air and it
just flies all the time. And

220
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:54,989
then you have that station where
you can get eyes on something or

221
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:57,029
you can do communications

222
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,290
Audrow Nash: So the idea Well, I

223
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,750
Helen Greiner: never I never
envisioned that the only thing

224
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,600
that company would do, but I
wanted some differentiated

225
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,320
technology to go in because
there were some drugs on the

226
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,340
market already.

227
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:16,169
Audrow Nash: So the idea was,
you'd have a cable that goes to

228
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:19,799
the drone, and that cable would
send power. And you could also

229
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,279
probably do things like maybe
some of the control, like the

230
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,349
brains of it, maybe I don't
know, if you want that on

231
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:28,919
Helen Greiner: putting the veins
oil on the robot, so you send it

232
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:33,419
up, and it just stays the or,
you know, autonomously. And you

233
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:35,669
know, what, that's a little bit
turnkey today. But at the time,

234
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:45,149
we were doing it, it wasn't so
much. We are, uh, you know, that

235
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:49,169
wasn't the the only tightness of
company it was a starting point.

236
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:52,409
And so we want some good
military, you know, multimillion

237
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:56,219
dollar contracts about that. We
were working on getting it into

238
00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:01,889
an acquisition program. And I
can tell you, there are many

239
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:06,269
companies building tele drones
today. So it was sci fi wasn't

240
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:11,129
successful, but the concept was
successful. And it's in pretty

241
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:14,819
hot demand for the familiarity
application applications because

242
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:21,749
of the capabilities to do both
surveillance. You know, I

243
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:27,989
getting eyes on 24/7. And also,
communications videos work a lot

244
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:32,249
better when you put them up
high. The effects of terrible on

245
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:33,299
the transmissions,

246
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,600
Audrow Nash: yeah, but it seems
to me like a really good way to

247
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,510
bootstrap infrastructure. Like
if you need to set up quickly,

248
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,910
it's like, oh, we have a
security camera that's deployed

249
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,560
there through a drone, it's kind
of thing or boost your radio up

250
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,990
and put it real high. Like
that's very nice. Very clever.

251
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,730
Okay. And so you said, so a few
things were interesting there

252
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,390
that you said. So first, you had
preparing it for acquisition?

253
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,270
Does it mean you kind of created
the company with the intent of

254
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,170
it being bought?

255
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,660
Helen Greiner: Oh, no, I am
sorry, I meant in that context,

256
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,860
I meant military acquisitions,
making sure that you're in the

257
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,580
palm cycle in the military
budgeting cycle. So that money

258
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,490
exists when you're ready with
the technology and prototype.

259
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,940
Yeah, and at the same time,
getting to a point where we got

260
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,220
it deployed, we did get it
deployed with a Rapid Equipping

261
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,250
Force and will then be used in
Syria and Iraq, very

262
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,010
successfully by a special
forces.

263
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,880
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. I mean,
that feels really good to

264
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,960
positively impact our troops and
it both iRobot and and sci fi

265
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,970
works. It's like you were
contributing to some of the

266
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,050
difficult situations,

267
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,140
Helen Greiner: it doesn't
matter. Some sci fi, someone

268
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:49,620
came up for Special Forces.
Perfect came up at a conference

269
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,070
and said, Hey, I heard that
thing is out there saving saving

270
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,080
lives. So you couldn't tell us
much about the missions, of

271
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,880
course, but actually, they did
tell us I was having great

272
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,870
effect. And the same thing that
I wrote about once. You know,

273
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,780
once I was speaking at the War
College, and I was between two,

274
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,840
you know, three star general, my
vide and a four star general on

275
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,570
my left, and I assumed everyone
would want to go speak to them

276
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:17,370
after the conference, but a lot
of the soldiers came up to me

277
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,240
and one guy, remember, he shook
my hand and said, I want to give

278
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,720
you my coin because this pack
bought saved 11 Guys on one

279
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,010
mission, and you know, that was
really rewarding can be the

280
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,250
Pentagon actually did a study
and the pack blood should have

281
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,580
been credited at that time, even
more today. But at that time,

282
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,010
they've been credited with
saving the lives of hundreds of

283
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,050
soldiers and 1000s of civilians.

284
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,140
Audrow Nash: Wow, that's
absolutely nuts. It feels like

285
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,770
it's kind of like, it's amazing.
And it's probably hard to wrap

286
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,950
your head around, like the
abstract notion of saving lives

287
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,130
for this kind of thing. But I
it's just wonderful. Like, what

288
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:53,820
a crazy thing.

289
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,130
Helen Greiner: Now, it is
wonderful.

290
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,570
Audrow Nash: And then so you
said that sci fi works wasn't

291
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,190
successful, in your opinion, or
this kind of thing. Oh, we I,

292
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,730
Helen Greiner: I live in the we
had a difference of opinion with

293
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,350
the investors that I bought on
in the direction. And at that

294
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:18,900
time, I decided, you know, the
person who first deployed the

295
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:24,720
PAC bots over in Afghanistan, he
asked me to come in and join, he

296
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,910
became the acquisition
executive, that's the person who

297
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,380
runs the, you know, the, you
know, multi billion dollar

298
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,770
acquisition flows on all of them
for the OMA and he wanted me to

299
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,160
come on and be his special robot
advisor. So I decided to take

300
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,940
that opportunity. Because I
didn't agree with the direction

301
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,050
of cycline.

302
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,010
Audrow Nash: Yeah, that must be
frustrating. I've heard many,

303
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,320
many people that I've talked to
that I started robotics

304
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,570
companies where the investors
wanted to go one way and the

305
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,210
founders want to go what another
way? It's a very frustrating

306
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,100
spot. Right? Right. Uh huh.

307
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,990
Helen Greiner: But at some
point, you got to say, you know,

308
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,930
they have that opinion. They're
gonna pick on that The people

309
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,120
and if those people make it
happen, the company's gonna be

310
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,600
successful. If they don't, it
won't. And I can tell you this

311
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,990
one was really well set up to be
successful because there's a

312
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,120
really hot demand for the
technology.

313
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,300
Audrow Nash: Yeah, and then so
but it just wasn't where you

314
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,820
were personally interested in
taking it. And then this other

315
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,600
opportunity popped up to advise
on government purchases of

316
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,560
robots, right?

317
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,440
Helen Greiner: The government
research and development of

318
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,990
robots AI and machine machine
learning.

319
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,140
Audrow Nash: That's super cool.
So that was, so I got to

320
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,130
Helen Greiner: work in the
Pentagon for two years. Which

321
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,400
was great. I mean, I, you know,
I stayed in Boston, where I

322
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,420
reside, but we went down,
though, every few weeks to spend

323
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,470
days down there. And, you know,
my office was the Pentagon?

324
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,350
Audrow Nash: That's so crazy.
Yeah. How was that? Like? I

325
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,080
don't I don't know much about
it, or what would be involved?

326
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,780
Like, what? I don't know, how
was it?

327
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,090
Helen Greiner: Well, after
selling, you know, over a

328
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,200
billion dollars worth of stuff
to military, right, it was

329
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,800
interesting to be on the other
side of the table, and see some

330
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,440
of the, you know, constraints
they're under, right? I mean,

331
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,860
there's a lot of hard working,
patriotic, very, very good

332
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,950
people, and you say, why can't
they just do this? And, you

333
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,440
know, sometimes there's a lot of
reasons that they just can't do

334
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,840
that, you know, mostly, you
know, it's against the law.

335
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,370
Audrow Nash: So, you know, give
me a specific example.

336
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,190
Helen Greiner: Well, you know,
even if they want the

337
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,220
technology, it has to go out for
competitive bid, and you have to

338
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,060
have the evaluation criteria,
and you have to, you know, go

339
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,090
through the process, because
someone will complain like that,

340
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,580
Congressman, and then there'll
be a bit dispute, and it's

341
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,790
better, especially when you're
dealing with billions of dollars

342
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,790
to get the program right from
the beginning. So you don't have

343
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:51,660
to, you know, lose it, you know,
later on, because the, the, the

344
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:56,400
soldiers need this equipment,
right. So, sometimes, you know,

345
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,740
even if it's a really, really
good product, and you know, it's

346
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,170
going to be the winner, you
really have to go through the,

347
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,340
you know, the process.

348
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,200
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. either.
Yeah. So that's interesting,

349
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,060
it's interesting to do that,
that's very different than like

350
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,880
how startups might operate, or
this kind of thing, because you

351
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,680
don't have the implications.
Like the voters and all of this,

352
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,890
if it goes badly, you just like,
do something and fail and try

353
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,610
and whatever. It's interesting
to be on the other perspective.

354
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:33,780
Did you? I don't know, like,
any. Like, I was very impressed.

355
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,920
So I talked to a previous
episode, Tim Chang, from DARPA,

356
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,880
about the sub D challenge. And I
was really impressed with that.

357
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:48,540
The like, it seems like a very
pragmatic approach in robotics,

358
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,290
to these hard challenges, and
I'm trying to start these

359
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,890
communities around around this
area, I should

360
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,200
Helen Greiner: say, DARPA does
have a little more leeway,

361
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,140
because of the way it's set up
to be able to work with

362
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:07,890
universities, and, you know, get
those great new ideas into the

363
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,190
military. But when you get to a,
you know, a knowledge

364
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:15,930
acquisition program, it has to
be, you know, go through a

365
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,530
process.

366
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,369
Audrow Nash: Yeah, so were you
kind of responsible for advising

367
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,749
these large purchases, or I
wasn't funding a process or

368
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,710
Helen Greiner: I was brought in
to give an honest opinion on the

369
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:34,020
state of the robot technology.
And I didn't take a role in any

370
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:39,180
particular acquisition program.
But I think people kind of

371
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,260
thought of me as a trusted
adviser, and I can't talk too

372
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,410
much about it. But I think I
really did have a great impact

373
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:51,120
and getting some of the, the
drone and the ground vehicle

374
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,850
programs in the right direction.

375
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,850
Audrow Nash: And how did how did
that end? So was it just the end

376
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,550
of the term? You have a two year
term? Or how does it

377
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,150
Helen Greiner: Yes, I I actually
went until my first appointment

378
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,960
and out and they would have had
me come back, but especially

379
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,990
with COVID. Like, I couldn't
even fly down to the Pentagon

380
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:16,410
anymore. And, you know, I, I was
at the point where I felt that

381
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,760
I'm doing something else to push
the robot field further would be

382
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,580
what I most want to do. I see.

383
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,580
Audrow Nash: Okay, and so now
this comes to Tertill, right.

384
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,800
That's the next jump. Okay, now,
tell me a bit about Tertill. Just

385
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,140
the set up in the premise and
everything.

386
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,680
Helen Greiner: Okay, so Tertill
is a company that builds a

387
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,070
weeding robot. It was invented
by the gentleman that I

388
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:44,460
mentioned, Joe Jones, who was
invented the Roomba when he was

389
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:54,960
I know but and he, him and Lloyd
McKee, again, he they were out

390
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,780
of they came out of harvest
automation, which was an

391
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:03,990
agricultural company. And once
they had finished with that,

392
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,920
they decided that they wanted to
be back in the consumer game.

393
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,190
And, you know, Joe, we're
thinking about all the different

394
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,330
applications that have robot
potential and weeding, you know,

395
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:19,050
is really at the top of a lot of
people's lists those jobs that

396
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:23,400
are just tedious and hard, and,
you know, you're in the hot sun.

397
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,630
And it's a job that, you know,
you do once in a while, you

398
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:31,710
know, find somebody who likes
it, right? Just like you're

399
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,900
fine. Believe it or not, you
find people that do like

400
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:40,350
vacuuming. There's always people
like that. But, you know, it's,

401
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,650
you know, a lot of people like
it, but they like it on their

402
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:50,250
schedule, like not when it has
to be done. So Joe, thinking

403
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:55,110
about the problem, he looked for
a robotic solution, because, you

404
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:59,160
know, we believe a Tertill that
an AI robot that you don't have

405
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,510
to do things exactly like a
human does. In fact, to be more

406
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,300
powerful, you don't really want
to do things exactly like a

407
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,860
human, you want to do them. You
want to set up the past, so a

408
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:16,080
robot can succeed. So an example
is, you know, maybe Roomba can't

409
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,530
do everything that an upright
vacuum does. But it should does

410
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,100
well going on to the beds.
Something that an upright vacuum

411
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:28,020
doesn't do well, doing under the
couches and the robotic

412
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:33,060
applications, it doesn't matter
how long it's on the you know,

413
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,960
covering the whole space, and
now with the latest technology

414
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,800
generations, ensuring that the
space is covered. So you know,

415
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,490
when you think about it in robot
terms, instead of in human

416
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,580
terms. So one way to do the
weeding to get back to total,

417
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:52,050
one way to do the weeding would
be you know, you have a fully

418
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,830
dexterous manipulator and you,
you know, you use your AI vision

419
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,620
system with lots of machine
intelligence, and you say that's

420
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,820
a weed, and then you come down
and you, you know, you have your

421
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,210
dexterity to go down and grab
the wheat and pull it up. And

422
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,520
then you have to grab it and
pull up the, you know, the

423
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:17,220
roots. Or you use events, lasers
or something like pesticides.

424
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,730
And in thinking about that,
that's a long way, right?

425
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,940
Because that plant has already
sunk nutrients out of the soil,

426
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:28,050
you have a disposal problem with
the plant. And you know, quite

427
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,900
frankly, powerful lasers are
expensive and pesticides.

428
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,210
Audrow Nash: Lasers. Yeah,

429
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,670
Helen Greiner: we always
consider lasers, because you

430
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,740
know, having a robot with
lasers, it's just inherently

431
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:43,860
cool. But may not be the most
practical approach. So what was

432
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:48,360
built instead was a robot that
prevents weeds from ever

433
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:54,900
growing. So with a scrubbing,
scrubbing wheels, it keeps seeds

434
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,340
from germinating. And with a
spinning weedwacker. If one does

435
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:07,350
pop its head up, off with it.
And original Loomba navigation

436
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:12,330
strategy, it negotiates through
the garden and covers the entire

437
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,580
area using local intelligence.
But it's got some inventions on

438
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:23,400
it. It's got capacitive senses
that sense the plants, and it's

439
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:29,670
got a very innovative pump
sensor that uses the

440
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,770
accelerometers.

441
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,710
Audrow Nash: So it actually,
would you just for our listeners

442
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,680
who are only listening, would
you describe it? Describe Tertill

443
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,010
a bit.

444
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,540
Helen Greiner: This is a small,
round green robot, it's about

445
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:51,210
eight and a quarter inches wide
and about maybe four inches

446
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:57,450
tall. And it's it's got wheels
that have cleats on them. Four

447
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:03,210
wheels that are a camford with
cleats on them that makes a

448
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:03,930
very,

449
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:10,080
Audrow Nash: you know, just at
an angle that 45 degrees. Yeah,

450
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,620
tilted so that they kind of like
scrape the Earth. Yes. And in

451
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,790
Helen Greiner: fact, we build a
not very good die system because

452
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,670
we want to be scraping the earth
when we turn rather than lightly

453
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,220
travel. Like many robot
applications.

454
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,730
Audrow Nash: That's so funny. So
you turn all the wheels

455
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:34,110
Helen Greiner: I think they skid
steer it's really the it's

456
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,920
really the combination effects
of scrubbing and then the weed

457
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,110
whacker that makes it do such a
good job.

458
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,850
Audrow Nash: So then in the
middle of the robot, so you have

459
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,700
the wheels and then in the
inside of the wheels in the

460
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,670
center of the robot there's a
little tiny spinning thing that

461
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,500
has like a wire like a weed
whacker.

462
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,220
Helen Greiner: Yes. It's not
just like a weed whacker. It is.

463
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:02,550
Yeah. This is the only thing
Part of the robot that that you

464
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,850
have to change, so maybe three
times a year, you have to pull

465
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:10,020
it out, within a, just do it
like that and you push it a new

466
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,230
one because it does wear out
when it hits locks and other

467
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:18,900
things in the garden. It does
have a little USB port here that

468
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,560
whoops, does have a little USB
port here that if you take this

469
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:28,200
off, you can see a little mini
den, I think it is where you can

470
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,650
plug it in and charger. But the
great thing about this robot is

471
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:36,330
you never have to, because it's
got a solar cell on the top. So

472
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,870
you're putting your garden at
the beginning of the growing

473
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:43,560
season, and you leave it there
and every day when the sun comes

474
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:50,580
out, it charges up when it gets
down to you know, when it was

475
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,890
when it goes out and weeds when
it gets down to something like

476
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:57,540
70% battery, and these all
changeable numbers, but 70%

477
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,200
battery, it stops weeding, and
it charges again, and then when

478
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,130
it gets to a certain number,
it'll come back out and do the

479
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,640
do the weeding and then when it
gets down. And that way, we

480
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,950
really use the batteries really
lightly. So it lasts for years.

481
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:20,310
You know you're using them so,
so nicely. And it makes it run

482
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:24,120
throughout the day. So if it's,
you know, if it's cloudy in the

483
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,120
in the morning light, it'll, you
know, keep running in the

484
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,110
afternoon, it also has some very
intelligent algorithms. So I'll

485
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:36,150
go sit at the sunlight, rather
than under a tomato bush. So

486
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,570
it's really a very intelligent
little robot that lives in your

487
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:43,380
garden runs on sunshine, and
does the weeding so you don't

488
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:43,920
have to

489
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,700
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So it
drives you basically set it in

490
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,840
your garden, and just leave it
and then what it's going to do

491
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,060
is charge period charge with the
sun and go knock out some weeds

492
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,580
when it drives around for a
small period of time each day,

493
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,030
Helen Greiner: individually
throughout the day, so it

494
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,300
doesn't just come out once it
comes out a few times every day

495
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,380
and does the job.

496
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,820
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. And so how
much ground can this little

497
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,600
robot cover?

498
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,210
Helen Greiner: About 200 square
feet of a garden. So that's

499
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:22,950
about you know, an average size
in ground garden. Some people

500
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,920
have smaller ones these days
with a you know a vase bed but

501
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:29,040
you know, if you're putting in a
garden you you know you have to

502
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,110
so it covers a reasonable sized
garden.

503
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,510
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. And it
detects the weeds to kill

504
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,580
because they're small enough to
drive over.

505
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,070
Helen Greiner: Well, it doesn't
really detect the weeds or kill

506
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:41,130
it prevents weeds from ever
growing. What we have to do is

507
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,710
protect the plants. Now, you
know, as I mentioned that

508
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:48,480
capacitive sensors are very good
and the accelerometer based bump

509
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,130
sensor is very good. But if
something's less than four

510
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,310
inches, it will consider it a
weed. So we do what all good

511
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:02,190
roboticists do to make robots
work and that's cheap. The way

512
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:08,340
we cheat is if you put a seed
in, yeah, well, I am what what

513
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:13,290
I'm holding is a thin wire
that's molded into a curved

514
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:18,720
shape that you can put a round
put around a seed that you

515
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,590
planted a small seedling that
you plant by just pushing it

516
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:27,900
into the ground. If you plant a
row of carrots, for example, we

517
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,680
have a row God and you just push
this these along the row so the

518
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,850
robot can't get to your carrot
seedlings. And once the plants

519
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:38,550
four inches tall you you can
take these out or leave them in

520
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:41,340
and it's really your choice to
take them out. You could just be

521
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:41,970
used them.

522
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,260
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Okay, so
when it's driving around, does

523
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,280
that mean that it's what weed
whacker is always going? So like

524
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,350
Does it smell plants? Or does
it?

525
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,480
Helen Greiner: It can sense the
plants, we've discovered that

526
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,860
having a duty cycle does
actually help the performance so

527
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:07,740
we can send so we can just have
a duty cycle just Yeah. And get

528
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:12,570
them all. Gotcha. It doesn't
take that much. Damage power,

529
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,760
especially when it's not hitting
anything.

530
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,950
Audrow Nash: Oh, you just keep
it spinning. Yeah.

531
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,320
Helen Greiner: We don't just
keep making it's got a duty

532
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:19,950
cycle.

533
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,350
Audrow Nash: What do you mean
exactly by the duty cycle? It's

534
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,220
on for a little bit.

535
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,650
Helen Greiner: It's gone for a
little bit. It goes off? Yeah.

536
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,780
Audrow Nash: Oh, is it? Okay, so
it's base. It's like almost like

537
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,020
it's full power than offer a
little bit than full power than

538
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,820
offer a little bit while it's
driving. So it's

539
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,790
Helen Greiner: yeah, you need to
have a weed whacker. You need to

540
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,730
have them spinning like a very
high speed weed whacker. Right.

541
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:47,550
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. And then,
so what what is what exactly is

542
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,740
it sensing in the environment?
So you mentioned that it can

543
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:52,590
move into the sun, if it's in
the shade.

544
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,569
Helen Greiner: That with its
solar power system light with a

545
00:34:57,569 --> 00:34:58,949
solar panel, so

546
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,040
Audrow Nash: it's going to drive
on till it reaches some sun kind

547
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,200
of thing, or how does it work?

548
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:10,530
Helen Greiner: It? Yeah, it just
doesn't stop. If it's too shady,

549
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,990
it keeps going for a while and
it you know, it looks at the

550
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:16,590
average reading over time and
goes back to, you know, web it,

551
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,670
it looks a bit if you know,
wants to know, make sure there

552
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,970
is some sun before it starts
looking for sun. So yeah, if you

553
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:27,330
have an average eating and, you
know, none of these things, you

554
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:30,660
know, these things are tuneable.
So we've done the best job we

555
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,140
can, you know, tuning them that
we that, you know, that we could

556
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,530
do, but they are things that we
can vary if we need to at any

557
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,100
time.

558
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:45,510
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Okay. So I am
imagining that this takes a lot

559
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,700
of lessons from the Roomba. So
like, one thing that was very

560
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,510
obvious to me as a like Roomba
tie back, is that you have the

561
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,720
one button. So like with the
Roomba, I have heard that it's

562
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,360
like you just have the one
button to start it. And this

563
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,360
Yeah, it has the one button as
well push it. And that just goes

564
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,230
and you don't have to worry
about

565
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,290
Helen Greiner: it didn't always
have one button, right? That was

566
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:07,650
a lesson learned. We had three
buttons, and they were labeled

567
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,080
S, M and L. So small, medium and
large. And we get questions all

568
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,160
the time. What's a small room?
What's a medium? What's a large

569
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,110
room, so then we started putting
numbers out there, then people

570
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,100
are really confused because they
don't know the area. And so it

571
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,060
was a little it'd be much better
to have one button. You know,

572
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,160
now they say clean on it. Right?
So that's what you want to do

573
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,750
you want to clean you press one
button. And the on off switch

574
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,750
the first ones we had on the
room, but were labeled zero and

575
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:42,270
one. So one is one is on and
zero is off. But you know,

576
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:47,640
people would say well, I put it
on. Oh, isn't that on? And it

577
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,120
was not obvious to most people.
40 year old

578
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,460
Audrow Nash: white men. That's
so funny.

579
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,460
Helen Greiner: Well, it's kind
of funny that we would do that.

580
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,660
Like, yes.

581
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,820
Audrow Nash: I mean as a
roboticist. Like, it's like, oh,

582
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,400
yeah, I got it. Like, yeah, I
know what you're going for. It's

583
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,930
like all you but it's not for
all of the other anyone who's a

584
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,820
general consumer, I see what
they mean with zero seems like

585
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:14,760
Oh, fraud. Like, it's totally
it's off to so.

586
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:17,340
Helen Greiner: Yeah. Yeah,
that's what the confusion was

587
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:22,710
like, why? Well, what about off?
Oh, so we designed it with one

588
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:29,880
button and the one button. You
know, it's, it's something that

589
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,720
people can understand, like, you
put it in the garden, you press

590
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,740
a button, and it stays there.
And it's on and it's running in

591
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,400
the garden for the rest of the,
for the growing season.

592
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:46,920
Audrow Nash: And then so, so the
operation of this as you just

593
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,530
put it there, you push a button,
and then you walk away until

594
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,700
winter, I suppose

595
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:54,210
Helen Greiner: that would be
ideal. That would be ideal. But

596
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:59,280
in reality, because we live in
reality. Mine and even though I

597
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,940
made my space pretty. I mean, I
am a little bit of a lazy

598
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,820
gardener. So my place isn't
really nice. And you know,

599
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,620
beautifully make do anything
like that,

600
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,030
Audrow Nash: but a good
roboticist would

601
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:15,270
Helen Greiner: if I had to free
it a few times during the year,

602
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,820
like it would get stuck, and I
would give it a kick. But that's

603
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,540
a few times as opposed to every
day, you never have to charge

604
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:27,240
it. You do have to replace the
weed whackers every, you know,

605
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,410
every few weeks, but apart from
that, you know you're good to go

606
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:36,450
for the season. So it really is,
I'd say one of the most if not

607
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,970
the most autonomous robot out
there because it's solar

608
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:42,540
powered. You don't have to
charge it. And it just stays

609
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,810
there and does the job for you.
Like a little creature living in

610
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:48,690
your garden? Like a Tertill?
Yeah, like a kettle?

611
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:53,580
Audrow Nash: Huh? Yeah, I see.
And so you mentioned that the

612
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,870
control style or the control
scheme is a bit like the

613
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,960
original Roomba. Does that mean
it's gonna just drive around

614
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,820
randomly? And then eventually,
like in the limit, it will have

615
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,020
covered the whole garden

616
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,300
Helen Greiner: space Yes,
although it's never been manned.

617
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,350
And the moon does whenever
random a us you know, local

618
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,610
intelligence based on the the,
you know, the local sense of

619
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:23,070
meetings, to negotiate along
walls about obstacles and to try

620
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:27,600
and cover you know, an area and
then move to the next area. So

621
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,540
neither you know, the original
room has went random and this

622
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:34,800
one's not random. We don't have
a full positioning system yet.

623
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:39,360
And you do have to put a
boundary around the area where

624
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,330
it's working like there was a
luxury in the house that the

625
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,900
walls originally that pretty
much we had a boundary because

626
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,630
of the walls. Turns out most
vegetable gardeners have a

627
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:52,290
boundary or they don't mind
putting one in. You can take a

628
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:56,460
piece of wood you can take the
VO Gods the pieces of metal that

629
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:01,080
it comes with you can buy at
stripping a metal one from From

630
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:05,520
Home Depot or Amazon, you know,
there's a lot of easy solutions

631
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:10,620
for it. But it is one of the
reasons why we don't advertise

632
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:15,180
it for landscape beds, because
it's a little tricky to explain

633
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:20,520
where it can and it can't work.
And, you know, you do have to

634
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,370
have a boundary of bounded and
some landscape bed, that's fine,

635
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:27,060
I've got one in a landscape bed
in the front of my house. And

636
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:32,070
it's wonderful, I don't have to
weed it. It's amazing. What I

637
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:36,120
didn't mind having, you know,
when you have, like, you know,

638
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:41,880
you know, some beautiful shrubs,
I have some bamboo in a, you

639
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,380
know, with a bamboo belly around
that most people can't stop

640
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:52,560
bamboo from growing, but my
bamboo isn't going so everything

641
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,820
else was going in that bed. So I
put, I put a barrier around the

642
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,390
where the bamboo Spedding farm
and I'm giving it a chance to go

643
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:07,140
in. I also put one on my gravel
last year, you know, got pea

644
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:12,120
gravel. And we can't advertise
for that either. Because at the

645
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,520
end of the season, I'd look
down, there'd be some little

646
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,700
portly plants growing that had
established a boot structure. So

647
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,730
that type of weeding we do to
venting, which doesn't quite

648
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:25,770
work. But where I didn't have
the Tertill weeds were like,

649
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:29,070
literally up to my shoulder,
like up to my shoulder. Like

650
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,000
it's crazy. What was how fast
the things could grow in a

651
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,290
growing season if you never take
care of it. So for me, you know,

652
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:41,190
it works great. If you don't
mind a few little leaves in your

653
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:45,750
in your gravel. But I you know,
advertising it for that would be

654
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,600
would be hard. But we have a lot
of users who use them on on

655
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,510
landscape beds, because they
figured it out for themselves

656
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:55,440
that I meet the criterion. And
so we can have it running. And

657
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,000
it's not a problem. You know,
you got to have your plan set of

658
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,630
space, at least about a foot
apart. You have to have not too

659
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:08,190
much. Exactly, yeah, yeah. So
the robot can go right between

660
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:15,150
them. You want to have not too,
not too much undulations a

661
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:21,210
barrier around it. And it
doesn't work on really chunky

662
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,630
mulch, like you know, a lot of
landscape beds are mowed. And

663
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:28,350
that prevents weeds. I put
motion fresh and even last year,

664
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:35,700
about a month later, I got weeds
all over. So it's really chunky

665
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,670
motion. It won't work. But I
have it working on both beds

666
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,710
that have final motion. It works
fine.

667
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:46,650
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So what
have been some of the biggest

668
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:50,820
challenges with this robot it?
I'm imagining weatherproofing it

669
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:55,350
it's interesting to have the
small set of sensors. I don't

670
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:55,590
know.

671
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:00,270
Helen Greiner: Well, I actually
jumped into this. After they

672
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:03,390
kick started it, and I bought
one on the Kickstarter. So I can

673
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,840
do this. Because my vote because
you know, Joe started the

674
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,140
company and I knew him and some
of the other guys and of course,

675
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:15,300
I'm gonna support the
Kickstarter. I, they delivered

676
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,270
it. And I you know, I put it in
the garden. And I think, you

677
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:20,760
know, it worked for a little bit
then it stopped working. And I

678
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,740
didn't care because it was a
Kickstarter, right. And it's a

679
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,740
robot and I buy lots of robots
on Kickstarter. And quite

680
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,340
frankly, I like that. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, anyone could tell me a

681
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,890
robot on Kickstarter. Because I
want robots to exist. I want

682
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:37,170
more robots to exist. Yeah. So
everyone should always support

683
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:40,440
the small robot companies just
you know, get the robots try

684
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,780
them out like that. So many
people said that to me about

685
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,480
Roomba. Like I got one of the
early ones and look at the

686
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:50,460
generation they have. It's like,
no, no, that's 10 years in. You

687
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,190
need to get to these companies
when the first kick started when

688
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,440
they're, you know, just have it
on the market for a few years.

689
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,380
But I was anyway, I got the
robot on the Kickstarter, but it

690
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,920
stopped working. And I didn't
really care. So but they

691
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,690
actually came over, took a look
at it and replaced it. And I

692
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,530
then I put it in my vegetable
gardens. And I was actually

693
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:16,530
amazed that it worked. It was
like night and day, right? It

694
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,260
was like instead of going to my
garden, and it was a weedy mess,

695
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,090
because I you know I'm not one
of those people who does it

696
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:26,280
every week, you know, on time.
Instead of going there with my

697
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,890
daughter and you know, I get
distracted because I don't like

698
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:32,190
the weeds in it, you know,
instead we can go and garden

699
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,220
together right? Instead of you
know, instead of it being a

700
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,790
chore it's like a more fun
experience about growing your

701
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:45,480
own food. So I really loved it
and they I was looking around of

702
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,380
what to do after the you know,
after the military appointment

703
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:53,850
and you know, I called them up
because I you know my mind I was

704
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:56,340
thinking about outdoor robotics
because you know, I'm not going

705
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:01,200
to go into us right because we
will visit inside I was

706
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,800
thinking, Hey, I see the robot
lawnmowers taking off, you know,

707
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,960
I've got a Tertill meeting my
goal. And that might be another

708
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,480
space that you don't they've
maybe thought about that and not

709
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,170
pursuing and I could take that
and learn from them. And

710
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,480
instead, they invited me to come
on and be CEO.

711
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:22,260
Audrow Nash: Wow. Gotcha.
Awesome. And so how long? How

712
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,000
long have you been with them now
as CEO?

713
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:30,750
Helen Greiner: Um, it's been
probably, it's been over a year

714
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:31,080
now.

715
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:36,450
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. What? So
were actually like a little bit

716
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,400
about the company. How large are
you guys?

717
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,170
Helen Greiner: Well, we don't
really disclose that because,

718
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:47,910
you know, we, you kind of keep
it to yourself until it's

719
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:51,990
something to really brag about.
But we're a small team. We're

720
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:56,190
very agile. We have the robot on
the market on our Shopify site,

721
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:00,840
we have it on at Amazon, we've
just released a new product did

722
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,260
make also makes gardening
easier. It's not a robot, but it

723
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:11,430
does. You know, it is it shares
the app with the the Tertill.

724
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:17,100
Okay, you know, so this is the
space that I love when a small

725
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,300
team can get stuff going quickly
and get, you know, get it out on

726
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:21,810
the market.

727
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:25,590
Audrow Nash: It does seem like
the most fun part. To me

728
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:30,720
anyways, the whole growing
everything. Very fun. So then

729
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:35,160
you guys are what kind of things
have you been? So since you've

730
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,450
been CEO? What kinds of things
have you been helping the

731
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,700
direction of the company move
towards?

732
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,700
Helen Greiner: Oh, well, I'm
just switching from, you know, a

733
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:52,380
technology band to a more
lifestyle brand. Getting the

734
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:59,910
word out more. You know, we got
on This Old House last last year

735
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:06,330
in USA Today. Wall Street
Journal. actually practicing

736
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:12,270
filming for an HSN slot will be
on Metro Bay on the 16th. So

737
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:20,160
there's a close $4 million
funding round last year. So

738
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,150
just, you know, trying to take
it from where it was, which was

739
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,560
great to

740
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:29,129
Audrow Nash: have more consumer
facing. Yeah, more

741
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:33,210
Helen Greiner: consumer facing
and more. Welfare.

742
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,560
Audrow Nash: Yeah, that's an
awesome thing. I mean, it just

743
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:41,220
seems like from my perspective,
like, the idea of pulling weeds

744
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:44,250
in a garden is like, I don't
know, because you're right,

745
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:46,740
like, like, I'm not going to be
diligent about it every week or

746
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,760
whatever. So this kind of thing,
it seems like a really nice use

747
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:55,950
of a simple robotics solution.
Like it can just drive around

748
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,530
mow down the big weeds, you can
like garden around your plants,

749
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:03,930
maybe if they go really close to
your existing plants, but it's I

750
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:06,600
don't know just makes the work.
It does like 80% of the work

751
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,350
kind of thing,

752
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,500
Helen Greiner: right? Yeah, I
mean, I still had some weeds

753
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,290
around the very edge of my going
like I could have ignored them

754
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,570
you know, sometimes I choose to
pull them out but it's a choice

755
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:18,900
like not not something you have
to go and spend a lot of time

756
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,320
doing.

757
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:22,650
Audrow Nash: And you don't have
like this giant like I don't

758
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,740
know field or bush of garden
that like you can't get to

759
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,920
anything and this kind of thing
because this is getting to all

760
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,540
those plants that grow super
fast, very early, and then you

761
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,470
don't have to deal with them.

762
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:40,499
Helen Greiner: Right? And it
goes to our you know you know,

763
00:48:40,649 --> 00:48:43,469
our mission is to make gardening
easier for people but why do we

764
00:48:43,469 --> 00:48:46,829
want to do that? So more people
take it up a lot of people took

765
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:50,579
it up in the pandemic by the way
people you know, studies say

766
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:54,419
like 17 million more people took
up gardening so great timing for

767
00:48:54,419 --> 00:48:54,719
it.

768
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,060
Audrow Nash: But

769
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:01,050
Helen Greiner: you know, we'd
like to encourage even more like

770
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:05,700
because what's more healthy for
the planet shipping it in, you

771
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,570
know, sometimes from another
country or, you know, wasting

772
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:13,530
all that transportation all that
pollution. Big Ag has a lot of

773
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:17,790
pesticides used out goods for
pollinators, not good for the

774
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:21,420
environment, not good for you
yourself. So having an organic

775
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,940
garden at home, if you can go
into a CSA that's organic in

776
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,810
your area.

777
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:35,070
CSA is I don't actually know
what it stands for. But you

778
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:41,160
know, it's when you have a farm
that allocates all their produce

779
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,400
that they make to a set of
customers and they deliver it or

780
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,520
you go pick it up every every
week. So it's kind of like a

781
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:53,070
shell in a farmers you know,
harvest August. Yeah. Wonderful,

782
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,590
very good thing to do. By the
way, we're not against that. We

783
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:58,770
totally promote that. I've done
it many times when I've not been

784
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:03,420
going my own stuff. I didn't go
on my own stuff when I was doing

785
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,590
iRobot. Because I knew that I
didn't have time. But I knew

786
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:10,290
that it would be too much time
and effort and I go on a

787
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:13,320
business trip, I wouldn't be
able to meet the goal. And so

788
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,380
something that I really love to
do is go and I couldn't do it

789
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,980
because of the weeding issue.
So, you know, what I love about

790
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,680
this company is we're solving of
this real problem that people

791
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,090
have, and it's good for the
earth because the the most

792
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,300
nutritious delicious food you
can get is actually from your

793
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,330
diet. I don't know if you have a
garden, or if you've ever grown

794
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,050
vegetables,

795
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,930
Audrow Nash: I I've grown
vegetables. I'm in San Francisco

796
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:40,590
and a little apartment, but I'm
likely moving to Texas in the

797
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:43,890
near future. Oh, so one of one
of the things we are most

798
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:48,360
excited about my fiance and I
are getting chickens and having

799
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,970
a garden. So we're right on the
same thing with you.

800
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:54,780
Helen Greiner: Okay, cool. Cool.
Well, I'm, I hope you all have a

801
00:50:54,780 --> 00:51:02,640
Tertill in the garden. Yeah. So
you know, because of the

802
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:09,630
nutritious delicious food
organic, being able to, you

803
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:14,400
know, save on that trend, you
know, transportation, pollution,

804
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,340
the fertilizer, the pesticides,
but also, you know, people take,

805
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:24,150
you know, to, you know, a bunch
of carrots and put them in a

806
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:27,900
plastic bag, right, and then you
have plastic waste, or anything

807
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:33,030
else. And so, you know, if you
need something, you know, food

808
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:36,570
waste is a big problem, too,
right? I've read studies that,

809
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,720
you know, between a third and a
half of the food is wasted

810
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,230
between when you pick it, and
when it gets to your table and

811
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:46,710
what you know what you don't
eat, right? There's a lot. It's

812
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,980
crazy numbers. But if you have
it in your garden, if you need

813
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,860
it, you just go get it for that
night. And it's better than a

814
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,500
refrigerator to have it, you
know, on the vine.

815
00:51:56,009 --> 00:51:59,759
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Mm hmm. I
really liked that perspective,

816
00:51:59,999 --> 00:52:03,119
where it's clever, and I wasn't
thinking of it until you brought

817
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,869
it up right now that this kind
of has a lot of like, you can

818
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:10,319
produce your own healthy food,
which is really, really nice.

819
00:52:10,709 --> 00:52:16,619
And then it requires less of the
whole infrastructure required

820
00:52:16,649 --> 00:52:19,409
for buying going and buying food
because the plastic that it's

821
00:52:19,409 --> 00:52:23,459
coming in the shipping, the
pesticides and things that are

822
00:52:23,489 --> 00:52:28,139
when the thing is being grown
from a huge agricultural

823
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:33,479
company. So it's really
benefiting the individual. And

824
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:37,650
Helen Greiner: so really like,
farm to table when you go to a

825
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:43,110
CSA, and we go a step further
and backyard to table. Yeah, but

826
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:45,630
we do, we don't call it CSAs.
Right, if you don't have the

827
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:49,380
opportunity to grow your own
vegetables. You know, a CSA is a

828
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,050
wonderful way to support a local
farmer.

829
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:55,260
Audrow Nash: Yeah, like I'm a
big fan of the regenerative

830
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,900
agriculture approaches where
they put a lot of effort into

831
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:02,130
the soil and have like a smaller
number of animals. And it sounds

832
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:06,420
very similar to the CSI and
probably how they structure

833
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,920
things. Interesting. It's so
it's so interesting to me that

834
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,030
it's a small robot with kind of
like big ambitions of helping

835
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:22,260
people and helping the planet in
this kind of thing. Do I did

836
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:27,150
you? In you figuring like
joining this company? Did you

837
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:30,720
have those ideas about this? Or
is this something that's kind of

838
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,470
come along? Since you've been
with the company or? I don't

839
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:36,360
know, like, how did you come to
that?

840
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:40,380
Helen Greiner: I did see it as a
way to encourage people to grow

841
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,320
nutritious and delicious food,
but I don't think I'd really

842
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:48,180
studied too much on how big ag
and the pesticides and the

843
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:53,280
transportation from other
countries. You know, just what

844
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,350
it takes to get food on the on
the table. I you know, I

845
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:01,920
honestly just love going I love
to see, go ahead and come to

846
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,270
life and produce, you know,
hundreds of pounds of food.

847
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,050
Audrow Nash: So I don't know
because I mean, I've grown food

848
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:14,490
a little bit but not never
really much. Can you like so if

849
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:21,930
I if I have a yard that is say,
Say say I have one turtles worth

850
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:25,680
of garden space? So I have 200
square feet? That was correct,

851
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,130
right? For one Tertill. Yeah. Of
garden space. How much food can

852
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:33,870
I make from that? If I'm gonna
do a good harvest?

853
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:38,100
Helen Greiner: If I had to guess
it would be a few 100 pounds. If

854
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:42,150
you if you wonder if you really
go well and you use fertilizer.

855
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,950
We actually just put out a
another product. There's not a

856
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,430
robot but I'll just briefly
describe it. It's a fertilizer

857
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:53,490
product. So a lot of folks who
beginning gardening don't know

858
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,820
that they they need fertilizer.
A lot of folks don't get that

859
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,730
soil tested and then you know
they come in they say I've just

860
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,280
got it Like thumb, it's like no,
you don't have a black thumb

861
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:07,080
you've got. Yeah. So we put out
a fertilizer plan. And the trick

862
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:11,160
that we're doing is we're going
to ship it with a soil test. And

863
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,530
when you get the results of the
soil test, it goes right to the

864
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:17,730
Tertill app, and we send you the
fertilizer that you need. So

865
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:20,790
instead of having to, you know,
get a PhD in soil chemistry, and

866
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:24,030
figure out whether you, you
know, whether you need

867
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:28,140
potassium, or magnesium or
whatever, all the

868
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,810
micronutrients, like, you know,
there's 26 of them or something

869
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:35,130
like that, we'll close that loop
and ship you exactly what you

870
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:35,520
need.

871
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:38,490
Audrow Nash: That's super cool,
because I've heard of like a

872
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:41,970
similar idea for like exercise
related things, or people with

873
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:44,460
their nutrients, where it's
like, you take a nutrient test,

874
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:48,780
or say, your goals or whatever
it might be, and then they send

875
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:52,020
you the appropriate supplements.
It's so cool to do that for

876
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,740
garden, where you go, and you
try the soil actually needs

877
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,080
these things. So I caught

878
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,420
Helen Greiner: the nutrient
thing is true or not, but I know

879
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:05,730
the soil test works, or every
land grant university had been

880
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,910
doing soil tests, and a lot of
them are at the point now where

881
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:14,220
they split it out. You know,
develop new nutrient

882
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,010
recommendations based on the
soil tested, tested for many,

883
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:21,990
many years. We're working with
Cornell University, where we,

884
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,990
you know, get these initial
recommendations, and then we

885
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:28,590
augment them. So this is
something that has been studied,

886
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:33,300
and it is science. It's not. You
know, when I hear something

887
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,960
about nutrition, I worry that
it's a it's, you know, like fad

888
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:41,130
pseudoscience. Yeah. Soil
Science is not pseudoscience.

889
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:44,010
Horticulture is not
pseudoscience. This is real

890
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:44,370
stuff.

891
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,690
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Yeah, it
really drastically improves the

892
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,770
yield of the plants, you're
saying, if you consider the

893
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:53,610
nutrients that the plant

894
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,530
Helen Greiner: don't even go by
some people, they get some, you

895
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:01,470
know, they get, you know, a few
little tomatoes on the tomato

896
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:03,240
plant, and they're perfectly
happy because they don't know

897
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,210
any better. And they don't know,
you can have this lush green

898
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:10,110
garden, if you fertilize plants,
and they're really heavy eaters,

899
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:14,340
right? Because there's so much,
you know, vegetables that, that

900
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:19,320
producing that if you don't do
it, your soil just gets worse

901
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,370
every day. Yes, yes.

902
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,190
Audrow Nash: Shocking nutrients,
right? Yes.

903
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,350
Helen Greiner: Suck the
nutrients out of the soil. So

904
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:29,160
even if you start out and you've
got great soil, those vegetables

905
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:33,660
are going to suck it out over
time. And every university that

906
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,500
you know, the whole cultural
universities, they all recommend

907
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:42,750
fertilizing and doing a soil
test every three years. So

908
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:46,290
that's the that's why we
actually got the parameters of

909
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:47,760
the program that we put out.

910
00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:50,729
Audrow Nash: That's so cool.
Would you think about like

911
00:57:50,729 --> 00:57:53,519
supplementing with chickens or
something that are going to make

912
00:57:54,150 --> 00:58:00,150
Helen Greiner: even better, even
better? I've had you know, fans

913
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:03,720
who do that, even composting
yourself, you could do that too.

914
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,810
But for people that don't have
the space, don't have the time

915
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:13,020
don't want to do that, you know,
because of the environment that

916
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,590
they may they may. Yeah, you
could just do it with

917
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:19,650
fertilizer, but we're not ever
going to say don't do that. If

918
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:21,570
you want to do that. That's what
you should be doing.

919
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:25,110
Audrow Nash: Yeah, and plus all
the bugs and stuff that you can

920
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,370
see with this kind of thing.

921
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,860
Helen Greiner: Not everyone
could get chickens either.

922
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,700
Audrow Nash: Yeah, it's true. I
think maybe it's like state. My

923
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:37,410
complaint don't get roosters.
Yes, yeah. In San Antonio, where

924
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,890
I'm looking the you're not
allowed to get roosters. But you

925
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:44,940
can have as many better known
hens as you are this kind of

926
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,110
thing. I'm so excited about it.

927
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,450
Helen Greiner: It's wonderful.
And you can get the eggs and

928
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,560
yeah, go with chickens. And
everything. Yeah.

929
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:58,950
Audrow Nash: So it seems to me
just kind of bigger picture

930
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:03,540
even. It seems to me that you
think that we have like there's

931
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,210
a lot of problems in the world
and with agriculture and

932
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:09,570
everything. And it seems like
your approach is kind of like a

933
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:15,000
bottom up approach. So it's like
get the people doing things,

934
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:18,840
make it easier for the people to
structure things so that they

935
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:22,170
don't have to rely on these big
systems quite as much can eat

936
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:24,870
healthier. Also, one of the
benefits we didn't bring up is

937
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,530
having people get outside to go
garden and this kind of thing.

938
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,590
It's a huge, like physical
activity for that kind of thing

939
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:34,200
seems really nice. Yeah.

940
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:37,410
Helen Greiner: Yeah, lots of
features. Studies show that

941
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:41,490
gardening is good for your
health. Less scientific, it is

942
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:46,050
good for your soul. It is good.
You know, it's just really,

943
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:51,210
really good for you. So you
know, it is something that we

944
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:54,150
do, we do want to promote.

945
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:59,250
Audrow Nash: You know,
selfishly. One thing I would

946
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:01,920
love if it was like I don't know
if you guys will be doing

947
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,290
additional products but if you
made like an automatic chicken

948
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:04,740
house

949
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,930
Helen Greiner: you don't have to
take it right to your garden but

950
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,550
me decided you got the chicken
scratching around them and they

951
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,830
poop it all. But you know, if
you're gonna get the chicken

952
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:21,150
poop, I would actually you know,
composted was something. That's

953
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:21,630
okay.

954
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:27,300
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So let's
see, the robots, the Tertill

955
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:31,860
robot sounds awesome. We have a
bit more time, I would love to

956
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:35,370
talk more about your path and
your opinions on robotics and

957
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:43,560
this kind of thing. So starting
with all that, you've made a lot

958
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,230
of transitions, it seems like
you've been on top of all these

959
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:51,720
really cool areas in robotics.
What? Like,

960
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:54,240
Helen Greiner: I guess I use
that I made a lot of

961
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:00,330
transitions. But I've been doing
this since 1990. Right. So I was

962
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:04,410
I did I have about 18 years and
you know, took it public. So

963
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:08,790
chairman for three more years.
So you know, I don't think of

964
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:12,450
myself that moves around too
quickly. I really jump into

965
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:20,010
something. But yes, I've been
able to see the growth of the

966
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,790
industry and I every robot
success I consider a success of

967
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:28,110
the entire industry of rising
tide truly does float all boats.

968
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:32,400
Audrow Nash: Definitely. Yeah.
And I was meaning transition and

969
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,120
more like, problem domains, or
this kind of thing, because it

970
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:40,320
was military. And then it was
home, and then it was drones.

971
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:45,510
And now then it was figuring out
how government works. Same thing

972
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:49,350
for military. So it's a little
more military. But now it's a

973
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:53,370
home robot for agriculture or
gardens.

974
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,070
Helen Greiner: Right? It all
comes together, like because I

975
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:58,770
knew a lot about home robots.
But now the areas that I'm

976
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:02,010
learning about with a great
advisory board is, you know,

977
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:06,720
the, I've been a gardener like,
but I'm not a horticulture best.

978
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:11,040
So I haven't studied that. But,
you know, we've got great

979
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:18,360
advisors who are amazing
multiculturalists. That, you

980
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:22,410
know, have shown us. You know
the science behind it.

981
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:26,250
Audrow Nash: Yeah. How do you?
So I guess one thing that's

982
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:29,730
really interesting to me is it
feels like with iRobot. And with

983
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:35,040
sci fi, and with Tertill, you're
picking very pragmatic robotics

984
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,820
applications, like given where
the technology is at the time

985
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:39,720
you pick something,

986
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:42,960
Helen Greiner: and also it also
in the Pentagon as well, but I

987
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,920
can't talk as much about that.
Well, yesterday, I was waiting

988
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,510
for the very practical
applications, and that's push

989
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:52,200
them fully.

990
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:55,110
Audrow Nash: If you ever can
talk about that. I would love to

991
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,450
do another interview on that.
Because that would be very, very

992
01:02:57,450 --> 01:03:00,570
interesting. I don't know if it
like has a time way of whatever.

993
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:04,140
Helen Greiner: I don't think I
would ever come to pad not

994
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:07,440
because they were particularly
secret because some vendors win

995
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,820
and some vendors lose. And this
is not my story. It's a story.

996
01:03:12,509 --> 01:03:15,329
Audrow Nash: Yes. Can you tell
me a little bit about that

997
01:03:15,329 --> 01:03:19,979
perspective of like, just how
you've kind of honed in on these

998
01:03:20,009 --> 01:03:23,279
spots where you can make a
simple robot that has a few

999
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:28,259
parts that something that
consumers can buy. And then it

1000
01:03:28,259 --> 01:03:31,169
provides a lot of value, like
Roombas helping people so they

1001
01:03:31,169 --> 01:03:34,529
don't have to vacuum especially
under the bed Tertill so that

1002
01:03:34,529 --> 01:03:38,609
it's like, it makes having a
garden a lot more feasible for

1003
01:03:38,609 --> 01:03:42,389
lazy people like me, where it's
like, no, I can do that I can

1004
01:03:42,419 --> 01:03:44,189
not do 80% of my weeding.

1005
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:51,510
Helen Greiner: Um, yeah, we we
had some amazing experiences at

1006
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:53,850
the first part of it well, but
for those eight years before we

1007
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:56,550
were doing the Uber, we won, we
did get some military contracts.

1008
01:03:56,550 --> 01:04:00,510
So we went to developing the
pack bots. You know, but all

1009
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:05,040
those other areas that I spoke
about oil and gas, commercial

1010
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:11,280
cleaning, toys and games. You
know, we did some SpaceX

1011
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,660
formation. And you know, we
really felt like we honestly

1012
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:20,100
felt that these areas weren't
wrong. We just didn't have all

1013
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:26,790
the pieces in place and we
didn't you know, you're turned

1014
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:30,720
out on the downhole Well, the
price of batteries went went up

1015
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,640
at the time and then on the
commercial cleaning it you know,

1016
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:41,070
the you know, the company felt
that it would obsolete the

1017
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:45,480
products that they're that they
were building and it so we had

1018
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:50,100
all these, like all these areas
and our heads that we knew that

1019
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,620
the could be successful robots
like I really think that

1020
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:56,610
commercial cleaning is a great
place for robots. Although a lot

1021
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:59,970
of companies just buy a Roomba
now because you can get them

1022
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,110
Good, yeah, it's kind of like
the cell phone, right? You don't

1023
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:06,720
say I'm going to build a cell
phone for industry, although

1024
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,930
that was, you know, big with
blackberry and stuff, but you

1025
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:16,290
just buy a consumer cell phone
and use it. But I really think

1026
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:20,250
that there are a lot of
industries that need still did

1027
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:25,110
great business opportunity even
today. And we were there, but we

1028
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:28,110
couldn't make it happen. But you
know, the timing was was wrong.

1029
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:32,040
And I do honestly believe that a
lot of times, it's just matching

1030
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:38,520
the technology to the market.
And it's not, you know, a lot of

1031
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,790
times, we were ahead of our
time, I see some space robot

1032
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:45,240
companies starting out and I, I
want them to be very successful.

1033
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:51,390
You're the first business model
that I will buy had was to do

1034
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:55,110
the first robot steps on the
moon, like, wow, coming out of

1035
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:58,740
university, that's what we
thought would get you I'll get

1036
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:01,560
some big sponsors. And they'll
be sure that, you know, help us

1037
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:06,630
do that. And we actually got
further than you would imagine,

1038
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:11,460
even in, you know, 1992, we had
a flight test at Edwards Air

1039
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:14,310
Force Base for the people who
make Brilliant Pebbles. And we

1040
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:17,640
did some, you know, you know,
not not yet we didn't get the

1041
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,120
space, right, but we were doing
it and they lost their launch.

1042
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:25,620
You know, they lost their launch
vehicle, and now they're on

1043
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:28,950
launch vehicles commercially.
Right. So I think the companies

1044
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:31,680
today have a better shot. And I
wouldn't say we were wrong, we

1045
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:37,650
would just, you know, early 30
years ahead. So we have aliens

1046
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:39,840
market timing as well. Yeah. I
mean, you can see what's going

1047
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,240
on in logistics and the number
of companies that have been very

1048
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:47,070
successful and fulfillment
centers. And I mean, because the

1049
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:50,250
time for that market has really
come on the market needed that

1050
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:53,040
if we had tried that in the 90s,
I mean, it was before E

1051
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,630
commerce, right? It wouldn't
have was

1052
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,130
Audrow Nash: how don't wait, so
go ahead. Oh, I'm just

1053
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:01,080
Helen Greiner: gonna say it
really is picking them lock it

1054
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,270
and the timing as well.

1055
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:07,500
Audrow Nash: How do you pick the
market and the timing? Like any

1056
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,620
any thoughts or heuristics on
thinking about that?

1057
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:17,040
Helen Greiner: Well, I for sure,
yeah. Yeah. I think what was

1058
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:20,580
well son who said Why Why do you
go Why do you rob banks is

1059
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:22,620
because that's where the money
is, you kind of look when the

1060
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:27,210
money's flowing. And you can see
money today and logistics you

1061
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:35,460
can see money today don't love
banks. In you know, the E

1062
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:39,600
commerce incredible books, so I
don't I obviously I don't think

1063
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:43,500
it's capped out, right. I keep I
keep like buying stuff MBA

1064
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:51,240
online. Underwater Robotics,
right. You know, there's just

1065
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,930
so, you know, people are looking
at, you know, how to service the

1066
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:58,860
wells how to produce geothermal
wells, right, there's, you know,

1067
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:03,270
so many with the wind farms that
are offshore, there's so many

1068
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:07,560
applications for underwater, you
know, being able to go out and

1069
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:14,340
do something, and then there's
you know, all the vehicle

1070
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:18,570
robotics, right, even the switch
to electric power, which is

1071
01:08:18,570 --> 01:08:21,210
happening now. I mean, that
helps, uh, you know, I think

1072
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:29,430
promote the robots. Nobody, you
know, robot inside. I, you know,

1073
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:31,860
I can honestly say, you know,
what I Robot, you know, as we

1074
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:34,410
had all the sticky notes on the,
on the wall, all the different

1075
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:37,710
industry, we had autonomous cars
up there, like we were watching

1076
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:45,420
the grand challenges, and we
even entered one, right. But we

1077
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:48,540
decided that the market timing
wasn't there, and we didn't see

1078
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:52,470
how we would ever get insurance.
And so we put it on the table.

1079
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:57,000
And it really took a company
like Google to jump in and get

1080
01:08:57,030 --> 01:09:01,470
those regulations change. So I
think we would like not to go

1081
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:08,940
there. But, you know, you see,
you know, companies like coups

1082
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:16,260
Rive and Zooks, you know, all
these companies. Yeah, so

1083
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:19,440
pushing on it. And of course,
Tesla and I know isn't Yeah.

1084
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,660
Audrow Nash: That is very
interesting. All those areas.

1085
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:27,600
Where do you where do you go to
get information for these things

1086
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,320
so you can look where the money
flows? Do you have any advice on

1087
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,480
how someone would see where the
money is

1088
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:38,310
Helen Greiner: flowing? I think
you have to become an expert in

1089
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:40,800
the industry that you're
entering. I don't say that

1090
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:46,740
lightly. Right. Because at
iRobot we didn't at first we

1091
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:49,560
thought we would be the
technology guys. And it wasn't

1092
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:55,530
until we became industry experts
that we had success. So

1093
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,040
sometimes the best way is to
hire someone who's been in the

1094
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,260
industry. You're trying to
disrupt it, you don't want to

1095
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,150
take everything they say, right?
Because you're not going to

1096
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:07,500
disrupt it if you do the status
quo, but people who know the

1097
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:12,150
economics of it, you know, the
multocida, Kima, like he had

1098
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:16,470
done. Part, I think it was, you
know, he was involved in one of

1099
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:20,820
the other, you know, ecommerce
delivery things and didn't get

1100
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:24,690
it to work. And then he had so
much experience with it. So he

1101
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:29,520
knew the field. And, you know,
figuring out what would work?

1102
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,610
Audrow Nash: Yeah, so that's
kind of a nice pair, you have

1103
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:35,520
someone who really understands
the industry, and then maybe

1104
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,220
some people that understand that
technology very well. And if you

1105
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:41,220
can kind of marry the two. And
that seems like a good way.

1106
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:45,540
Helen Greiner: Yeah, well bang
people on learn about it. You

1107
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:51,060
know, I think a lot of Abbas's
have usually, you know, a little

1108
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:54,810
bit of jack of all trades if
you're a roboticist. So you're

1109
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,600
probably pretty good at picking
up new things. So you know, it

1110
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,530
is possible to learn about
there's plenty of information on

1111
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:03,660
the web, there's plenty of
people who are willing to talk

1112
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:06,750
to you, there's, you know,
there's all these companies that

1113
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:10,410
just put out market research for
a living like this. There's so

1114
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:12,870
much information out there,
thanks to Google and others,

1115
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:17,040
right, that it's not like it was
in the 90s. Where, you know, you

1116
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,180
go to the library, right?

1117
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:22,500
Audrow Nash: Yeah, gosh, now
everything is just a Google OA.

1118
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:29,910
It's a crazy time. Okay, um,
what do you think? So, if

1119
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:34,050
someone wanted to start a
company now, in robotics, what

1120
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:34,950
advice would you give them?

1121
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:43,200
Helen Greiner: Um, be ready for
ups and downs. There are a few,

1122
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:48,480
you know, get on the lucky ship,
so to speak, Locus robotics

1123
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:53,250
seems to be on a good
trajectory. And even then, my,

1124
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:58,740
they were incubated quite
logistics for quite a few years

1125
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:01,950
before they spun out. So they
had that opportunity to get the

1126
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:08,220
technology ready before, you
know, before the, you know,

1127
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:12,780
going for that, you know,
economic blockade show.

1128
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:15,060
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. So,

1129
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,360
Helen Greiner: yeah, a lot of
times you can find, you know,

1130
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,660
find something that's like a
long time to trace things back.

1131
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,480
It's not that people just got
together and built something,

1132
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:28,410
but there's something that was
late it was working, or it

1133
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:32,400
failed somewhere else, and
you're taking it in or, because,

1134
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,910
you know, the reason that didn't
work or at a university

1135
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:39,990
gestating topic when you know,
something, maybe a challenge

1136
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:43,230
funded it, there's so many ways
it could come from a large

1137
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:46,770
company that doesn't want to
take it forward, spin out or

1138
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:53,310
spin out a company from it. But
just getting it to the point and

1139
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:55,830
getting all the capital
together, just you know, a

1140
01:12:55,830 --> 01:13:00,090
straight shot, I think is
reasonably difficult. You can do

1141
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:06,180
some alternative funding, like
government contracts, like not

1142
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:08,610
just SBIR. But there's many
different programs in the

1143
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:12,330
government to try and get the
innovative people to get the

1144
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:13,380
technology, though.

1145
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:16,440
Audrow Nash: So SBIR, that's
Small Business Innovation

1146
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:22,350
Research, right? Yeah. How do
you. So if you want to pursue

1147
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:24,900
the path of an alternate source
of funding, so you can kind of

1148
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,960
bootstrap a startup and doing
the market research, you can

1149
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:32,250
find a good fit? How does one
learn about these government

1150
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:35,220
research grants or government
grants that way they could do

1151
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:35,430
well,

1152
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:38,190
Helen Greiner: you can learn
about the process by meeting it

1153
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:41,790
right. It's an easy, SBIR
program does a great job of

1154
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:45,870
putting everything out there.
But in reality, you should be

1155
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:49,170
talking to people that have a
need for your idea. Because if

1156
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:56,310
you're not you're I mean, it's a
real statistic statistics are

1157
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:59,430
there for you not to get
something if you haven't been

1158
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:03,600
talking to people about your
technology about the way you see

1159
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:08,340
the problem, your innovation,
because I you know, it's hard to

1160
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:12,210
get things from a proposal Lily,
it's not that you cannot win

1161
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:19,590
right. But you know, it does
help to Yeah, but I will also

1162
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:24,660
look at other types of programs
that the government runs in, in

1163
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:30,000
in innovation that some contests
the incubators are amazing these

1164
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:39,240
days. My challenge I mean, NASA
robotics you know, my head

1165
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:40,950
Audrow Nash: specifically

1166
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:45,000
Helen Greiner: not NASA Onyx is
I think it's a little more

1167
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:49,800
national. Now. They have
companies that uh, you know, not

1168
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,240
just in in Massachusetts, the
actual physical mass robotics is

1169
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,580
in Massachusetts, but I've heard
of companies that have

1170
01:14:56,580 --> 01:15:00,930
participated that are from
around the country. We're

1171
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:03,450
actually doing a total we're
doing a massive robotics

1172
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:07,950
accelerator right now with
Amazon Web Services. That's been

1173
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:11,970
a very, very good learning
experience.

1174
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:15,030
Audrow Nash: So it means you're
using you're using, you're doing

1175
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:18,960
an accelerator to get your stuff
using Amazon Web Services, or

1176
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,740
Helen Greiner: they're coming in
and they're giving, you know,

1177
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:27,300
classes on what technologies
Amazon Web Services about Robo

1178
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:31,740
maker about, you know, the
infrastructure behind it, which

1179
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:40,500
you know, so well. I know, and
also, panels on raising venture

1180
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:45,660
capital panels on, you know,
exiting panels on all the things

1181
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:47,640
and you might say, Hey, you
don't need that hell away, you

1182
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:51,090
taking up this face? You can
always learn more like it's a

1183
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:54,540
different funding environment
from you know what I did with

1184
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:58,170
iRobot? Like, we were one of the
first write comments on venture

1185
01:15:58,170 --> 01:16:02,580
capitals, like, oh, they don't
make investment in this space.

1186
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:08,880
That's to science fiction, I
thought this would kill me. But

1187
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:14,460
I persevered, right. And I found
some very, very good, forward

1188
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:23,070
looking venture capitalists to
get to come in. I forgot where I

1189
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:27,930
was going. But you know, this.

1190
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:31,800
Audrow Nash: Go ahead. So it?
Yeah, you found these forward

1191
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:36,480
looking venture capitalists and
it helped you find it basically

1192
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,090
let you proceed, even though the
times weren't quite there. So

1193
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:41,610
now we're at a different time.
Yeah. In the investment

1194
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:46,380
community. And these incubators
seem to be really nice. Onyx and

1195
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:48,720
all the talks and all the
education they're providing

1196
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:49,590
sounds wonderful,

1197
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:51,450
Helen Greiner: right? And then
Okay, so one of the reasons for

1198
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:56,280
participating is we, you know,
the data infrastructure that

1199
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:01,650
Amazon Web Services has, of
course, is great for storing the

1200
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,420
data that we're collecting.

1201
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:09,060
Audrow Nash: Mm hmm. Yeah. So
are you using like their IoT

1202
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:11,910
service? I think it works well
with I don't have experience

1203
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:15,780
hands on with Amazon Web
Services been robomaker. And

1204
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:18,600
these kinds of things other than
like some basic s3 stuff, or

1205
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:22,980
whatever it is, but are using
like their Greengrass platform,

1206
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:24,840
which is for Internet of Things?

1207
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:28,080
Helen Greiner: We are actually
not we are on a much lower

1208
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:31,590
powered process, but we're
learning about it to see if we

1209
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:37,830
can make use of future you know,
micro loss, for example, you

1210
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:44,400
know, the, the simulation
environment, that bubble maker,

1211
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:49,920
which is built on Zeebo, because
Eva, like, that's what I was

1212
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:56,250
gonna say, um, you know, so, we
make, can we make use of that,

1213
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:01,350
to augment our, you know, common
simulations, which are probably

1214
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:05,430
not as high fidelity as Amazon
has been able to, to put

1215
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:08,460
together and then you know, the
changes in the environment and

1216
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,680
stuff, so you can always learn
more, and I was saying the

1217
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:17,100
funding environment, right, the,
you know, with AI robot times,

1218
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:22,470
right? You know, they didn't
have this, you know, convertible

1219
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:26,700
notes as much, and suddenly,
safes hadn't been invented. And

1220
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:29,790
now, if someone was starting a
robot company, I'd recommend

1221
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:39,690
start a safe, which is, it's a
investment. You know, like, like

1222
01:18:39,690 --> 01:18:44,010
a convertible note, but it's not
a debt instrument, it is, it

1223
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:49,830
basically just converts to
equity, or when another funder

1224
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:53,010
puts a price on it later. So you
basically sign up, you get a

1225
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:56,790
discount on the, you know, on
the bound, and some people don't

1226
01:18:56,790 --> 01:19:00,660
even have a discount on the
bound, no interest, and it lets

1227
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:05,310
people come in and fund your
company. You know, it turns out

1228
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:08,640
there's a lot of high net worth
individuals out there now who

1229
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:14,550
are willing to, you know, fun
robot companies. So you can go

1230
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:17,790
out, start a safe and start
getting that traction with

1231
01:19:17,790 --> 01:19:22,050
investors and maybe, you know,
maybe it's 25,000 100,000

1232
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,900
quarter million at a time, but
it's easier for them to make

1233
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:28,620
that decision. Like, you know,
we've had to make that decision,

1234
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:31,800
you know, kind of on the spot
rather than the process you have

1235
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:35,970
to go through to get a lead VC.
So you can get get that funding

1236
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:39,480
going. And then when you go to a
lead VC, you have that traction

1237
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:43,770
already and so you know,
hopefully some good names, you

1238
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:47,820
know, names people have, you
know, people have Yeah,

1239
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:53,940
respected in the industry,
funding the company, and also it

1240
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:57,270
gives you advocates for the
company and people you can call

1241
01:19:57,270 --> 01:20:03,810
for help and you Want to push to
the next level? So, so like my

1242
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:07,530
only point is not safe. So not
there's a lot of different

1243
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:13,140
mechanisms to get funded. But
the environment does change. And

1244
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:16,140
you have to keep up with that
environment. So no matter how

1245
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:20,460
much experience you have joining
something like an incubator can

1246
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:21,570
be helpful.

1247
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:25,350
Audrow Nash: Yeah, so you guys
are doing the incubator now,

1248
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:28,950
which is so cool. You're doing
the AWS one that is?

1249
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:33,510
Helen Greiner: Yeah, it had a
criterion. You know, you can't

1250
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:39,060
do you know, over a few million
dollars of business. So we still

1251
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:40,170
we still made the cuts.

1252
01:20:40,829 --> 01:20:46,169
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Gotcha. No,
that's really cool. Let's see if

1253
01:20:46,169 --> 01:20:57,059
there was Do you think so? The
whole con. So with? I guess,

1254
01:20:57,059 --> 01:21:02,489
actually, when you are creating,
so one thing that's different

1255
01:21:02,489 --> 01:21:05,459
with robotics versus other
industries, I feel like so if

1256
01:21:05,459 --> 01:21:09,359
you're doing like, a software as
a service thing, so it's going

1257
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:13,589
to be some web app that people
use, investors look a lot at,

1258
01:21:13,829 --> 01:21:16,949
are you already getting users?
Are you already showing that

1259
01:21:16,949 --> 01:21:20,489
you're profitable? Or whatever?
With robotics, there's a big

1260
01:21:20,489 --> 01:21:26,849
investment in capital. And you,
I don't know, the model is

1261
01:21:26,849 --> 01:21:30,119
different, because you have to
build your robots, and you have

1262
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:34,769
to building up the supply chain
and manufacturing. Yeah, go

1263
01:21:34,769 --> 01:21:35,069
ahead.

1264
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:37,860
Helen Greiner: No, I think
that's true. But it's less true

1265
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:41,790
now than before, because you
could get a prototype together.

1266
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:46,350
Much easier. Like because of the
open source robot Foundation,

1267
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:48,960
because of open robotics, I
should say, because of the

1268
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,020
simulation, because of what
happens on Web Services is

1269
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:57,780
doing. You know, because of the
global infrastructure, because

1270
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:02,760
of what the video is doing, you
can actually get a prototype,

1271
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:07,680
you can buy a robot on to test
out your idea. So I think a lot

1272
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:10,470
of people aren't building
everything from scratch, you

1273
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:14,850
know, a lot of the code to get
things, you know, tried is, you

1274
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:17,730
know, is out there already, we
have to modify it like, but it's

1275
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,910
a whole different modifying it
than creating the whole robot

1276
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:27,180
infrastructure yourself, which
is what we did at iRobot. So

1277
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:36,210
you, you know, and in some
applications that put together

1278
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:40,200
commercial pieces can actually
be a product. And then as the

1279
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,720
product gets more more
successful, you might fine tune

1280
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,830
it. In the till application,
that's not true, because it

1281
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:50,550
really has the cost is king for
consumers, you really do have to

1282
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:54,450
design it from the ground up to
get the costing that you need to

1283
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:57,420
get for consumer products. But I
see people going into the

1284
01:22:57,450 --> 01:23:02,340
industry now with these
commercial, you know, available

1285
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:05,700
infrastructure and getting stuff
together so much quicker than we

1286
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:10,080
could have ever dreamed of doing
it in the past. So I see.

1287
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,720
Audrow Nash: And so one thing
that's interesting to me with

1288
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:19,620
this is, it seems like a lot of
the robotics prototypes, kind

1289
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:22,590
of, as you've been saying, with
this, it's a lot of business to

1290
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:26,430
business transactions. But you
guys are going business to

1291
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:28,590
consumer and you were saying
that for consumer products, you

1292
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:32,580
need to really design so that
you can keep the cost as low as

1293
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:36,750
possible. i There's a lot of
business to business potential.

1294
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:39,840
I think in robotics, like if
you're selling things to help

1295
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:43,440
stock shelves, or do security
guards or whatever it might be,

1296
01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:47,250
but business to consumer is
something that's been kind of

1297
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:50,220
hard for robotics to break into.
And there's the Roomba, and

1298
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:53,250
maybe the Tertill will we'll see
in the near future, but it seems

1299
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:56,190
like you might be connected to
two of the most successful ones.

1300
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:56,700
Right.

1301
01:23:56,730 --> 01:24:02,100
Helen Greiner: But I would also
put the DJI and the audio tones

1302
01:24:02,130 --> 01:24:10,680
in that mix. Right. But I, you
know, I there's been a few that

1303
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:14,280
are more, you know, either a,
kind of bordering on a toy and a

1304
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:18,720
game and I feel that those don't
usually come out over over time,

1305
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,800
I really think it has to be a
practical application that

1306
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:27,240
people have this real need for
and then you know, that the

1307
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:31,290
Moomba is cute and bleeps and
bloops. And the Tertill has, you

1308
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:34,980
know, patent you know, found as
it takes off and stuff. I mean,

1309
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:39,690
I think that helps. But it's not
the primary reason why people

1310
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:40,260
buy it.

1311
01:24:40,590 --> 01:24:43,020
Audrow Nash: It's not the value
offer. Yeah, for sure. Like it

1312
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:46,500
really does something useful.
Yeah, rather than the cosmetic

1313
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:50,280
beeps and boops Yeah, and the
whole value of the product.

1314
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:55,440
Yeah, I wonder Do you think the
robotics consumer space will

1315
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:59,970
grow in this like the will keep
finding ways of having less

1316
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,020
betting on it.

1317
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:02,730
Helen Greiner: I'm certainly
betting on it. Because once you

1318
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:05,670
have, you know a robot, cleaning
your floors, mopping your

1319
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:11,220
floors, doing your pool, doing
your lawn, doing your weeding,

1320
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:13,740
right, I think people, you know,
look at it. It's like, why don't

1321
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:16,920
I have a vote but to do these
other things? Yeah, I told him

1322
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:20,850
it's robots in unstructured
environments are an actual

1323
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:26,160
challenge. Right? Yeah. And so,
you know, so again, I do suggest

1324
01:25:26,310 --> 01:25:35,970
cheating, like we do with the
kernel. You know? Because making

1325
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:41,880
it so it's a robot, um, you
know, that you do the jobs

1326
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,730
robotically, like like the
Roomba going under beds and

1327
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:48,000
couches makes it so they do
something that you couldn't

1328
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,890
really do any other way.

1329
01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:56,370
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Let's see. Do
you getting big picture again?

1330
01:25:57,450 --> 01:26:01,530
Where do you see robotics going?
In the next like, say, five

1331
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,850
years or so five to 10 years?
What do you better life looks

1332
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:08,670
like and how are robots around?
Or what's the robotics industry

1333
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:09,660
look like? Oh,

1334
01:26:09,690 --> 01:26:14,130
Helen Greiner: I mean, it's such
a great time. But I think it's,

1335
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,480
you know, it's a little like

1336
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:22,860
you know, some pet kind of like
computers like that is a

1337
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:25,890
computer Mandal see? Certainly,
and, you know, I'm using one to

1338
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:28,860
communicate today. But there's
computers in everything, right.

1339
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:33,720
And I think that's going to be
MOBOTIX in everything is almost

1340
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:37,560
not a field, I can think of a
physical field that you wouldn't

1341
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:41,910
want to have a robot adjusting
in the future. So I'm, I'm

1342
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:48,900
bullish on robots, obviously.
You know, but all the jobs that

1343
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:53,700
people don't like doing, I mean,
I constantly get requests, and

1344
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:59,700
nobody's cracked it yet. But I
have seen prototypes. And you

1345
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:06,090
know, that's one company I
invested in. I tend to buy it

1346
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:08,520
that's collecting tennis balls,
you know, if you're, you know,

1347
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,980
doing serving practice, it just
goes out and collects henna

1348
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:13,740
balls. And that's, you know,
some of that technology, you

1349
01:27:13,950 --> 01:27:15,900
think, Well, that could have
been done in the 90s, right?

1350
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:19,410
Because we had a little green
ball chasing robot running

1351
01:27:19,410 --> 01:27:22,350
around the company for a long
time, but we didn't make any

1352
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:29,100
friends of ours did. And it was
great fun made it just like you

1353
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:31,680
put a ball on and zoom and
everyone's like, I want that.

1354
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:36,300
It's like, why. And now they're
making it to collect tennis

1355
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:42,960
balls. And you know, I've seen
people try to do folding the

1356
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,170
laundry. I haven't invested in
that one. But I mean, a lot.

1357
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:50,370
Yeah, it's hard. But there's so
many people who say to me, I

1358
01:27:50,370 --> 01:27:54,450
would buy it in a minute, like,
oh, you know, ironing, right?

1359
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:59,220
Um, you know, if you can come up
with a robotic solution to some

1360
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:02,850
of the things that people we
help people have to do every

1361
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:09,540
day. And, you know, that's what
I think with with a Tertill, you

1362
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:14,370
know, weeding is like mowing. I
love the robot lawnmowers.

1363
01:28:14,370 --> 01:28:18,270
Right? But you can have someone
come in and mow your lawn. But

1364
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:20,760
weeding it's actually hard to
get someone to come in and wait

1365
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:23,940
for you because it's a job.
Nobody really wants, right. It's

1366
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:28,770
it's fiddly. It's out in the hot
side. If there's no machine to

1367
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:34,740
do it really. It really is
something that a lot of kind of,

1368
01:28:34,770 --> 01:28:35,970
like elbow grease right.

1369
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:42,720
Audrow Nash: is required. Yeah,
for sure. Okay, now, wrapping

1370
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:48,060
up, you mentioned you're bullish
in robotics. How do you see

1371
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:53,280
robotics as like, important in a
bigger picture sense? Like why

1372
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,660
are you bullish in robotics?

1373
01:28:56,460 --> 01:29:00,060
Helen Greiner: Because I just
see all the applications that

1374
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:11,280
robots can lend a hand to you
know, it's important because I

1375
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:15,540
think that you know, like, like
anything else, you know, people

1376
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:19,410
worry about robots, people
worried about computers. But I

1377
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:24,240
think they they just add such I
mean, computers have added so

1378
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:28,920
much people couldn't have even
predicted at the time that in

1379
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:32,940
communications to doing the
school virtually by in the

1380
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:38,370
information were able to access
and robots I think we don't even

1381
01:29:38,370 --> 01:29:43,440
know what great things they're
going to be able to accomplish

1382
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:49,830
yet. And keeping the environment
safe, safer. Getting rid of the

1383
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:56,970
pesticide usage. You know,
helping with you know, getting

1384
01:29:56,970 --> 01:30:03,000
geo FOMO thermal and wind farms.
going, you know, I, I would

1385
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,480
imagine if we do get fusion
reactors like there'll be robots

1386
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:10,530
servicing them. And like, I
could just see that they have an

1387
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:13,710
infrastructure that most
everything's going to depend on

1388
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:17,100
to, you know, just to make it
