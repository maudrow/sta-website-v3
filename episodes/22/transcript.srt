00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,490
Audrow Nash: This is a
conversation with Ben Raanan who is

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,450
a software engineer at the
Monterey Bay Aquarium Research

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,530
Institute, or MBARI, for short.
MBARI uses robots to

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,100
monitor and explore the oceans
to better understand climate

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,540
change, and other topics. In
general, getting ocean data is

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,440
extremely expensive. Depending
on how far the area of interest

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,250
is from the shore, it may
require a large boat with a full

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,090
crew. MBARI is working to
make this process easier and

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,530
much cheaper by having robots
stay at sea for weeks at a time

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,070
getting data on different ocean
events. This generates a lot

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,410
more data and will hopefully
greatly improve our

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,070
understanding of our oceans. I
found it exciting to talk with

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,270
Ben about how MBARI is looking
into having robots stay at sea

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,080
almost indefinitely, charging
their batteries and uploading

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,740
their data all while at sea.
This could enable fleets of

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,670
robots to continuously be at sea
giving us a much richer picture

17
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,870
of the health of our oceans. I'm
Audrow Nash. This is the Sense

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,260
Think Act Podcast. Thank you to
our founding sponsor Open

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,010
Robotics. And now here's my
conversation with Ben Ron on.

20
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,250
Hi, Ben, would you introduce
yourself?

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,470
Ben Raanan: Sure. Hi. My name is
Ben Ron on a oceanographer and

22
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,290
robotics software engineers here
at the Monterey Bay Aquarium

23
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,530
Research Institute. Or we're in
MBARI, for sure. We're in

24
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,720
Barcelona, California. I've been
here with the Institute for

25
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,390
probably coming on years now.
Working as an engineer, a

26
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,720
bedroom about my background,
actually, motion career about 20

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,310
years ago, I was a special
warfare operator and a combat

28
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,460
diver in the Israeli Navy. And
spent a good chunk of time with

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,550
the teams there. And later on,
got my undergrad in r&d tax and

30
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,880
biotechnology back home in
Israel. And then came here to

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,840
get my Master's in physical
oceanography. At that point, I

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
got involved here with the
Institute through an internship,

33
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:17,220
and then I just refused to
leave. Yeah, so now mostly what

34
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,900
I do is I work development and
operations with autonomous

35
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,430
underwater vehicles. And so I
have a few projects running, but

36
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,640
I think you're interested in
looking for talking about

37
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:35,069
Audrow Nash: awesome. So what
kinds of projects do you guys do

38
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:35,759
at MBARI?

39
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,080
Ben Raanan: Yeah, so I guess
maybe we before we dive into the

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,650
projects, can tell you a little
more about embargo in general, I

41
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,270
think, sure, you may be
familiar, but others may not. So

42
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,400
like I said, we're in Moss
Landing Fornia in the Central

43
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,650
California, say probably about
an hour south, from San Jose, on

44
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,690
the coastline, in the Monterey
Bay. And in MBARI is actually a

45
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,760
pretty unique Ocean Research
Institute, in the sense where

46
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,850
we're a private nonprofit. So
the institute is not an academic

47
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,140
Institute, it's kind of been
founded as an alternative to

48
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,070
what an academic Institute can
be for ocean research, in bars

49
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,850
funded almost exclusively,
through the David and Lucile

50
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,280
Packard Foundation. And David
Packard, which is the P and HP

51
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,000
and Hewlett Packard, he founded
this, yeah, he founded this

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,310
institute in 1987. So we just
celebrated our 35th birthday.

53
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,140
And the mission back then was
to, like I said, offer an

54
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,900
alternative to traditional
academic research institutes,

55
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:51,720
and take on challenges that
require development of

56
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,170
technology in order to, you
know, answer some of the

57
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,670
scientific questions that marine
scientists have. And so that's

58
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,890
kind of been the goal of
Institute and also remove a lot

59
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,160
of the, I guess, barriers,
especially when it comes to

60
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,730
funding. And so scientists and
engineers here get to focus more

61
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,790
on the doing and less than
they're proposing. And so we

62
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:22,320
have an internal proposal cycle,
in which we, you know, for our

63
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,990
budget, and then we get funded
through Packard Foundation,

64
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,180
which is phenomenal, it's
absolutely great. And so, the

65
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,020
type of the way the institute is
structured is we're actually

66
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,720
kind of like a three legged
stool. And our trifecta, never

67
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:46,530
skip on an opportunity to say
that word. And so, so, the

68
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,410
Institute has about 220
employees. We are divided into

69
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,260
science, engineering, and Marine
Operations. And we work very

70
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,760
closely together. So Though the
barrier or the the boundaries

71
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,550
between the groups is very
blurred, you know, you got a lot

72
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,700
of scientists that are very much
engineers and engineers that are

73
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,110
scientists and they work
together to find the questions

74
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,860
that need to be answered. And
then develop the technology that

75
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,580
allows us to go out and get
that. And then the Department of

76
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,690
Marine Operations has the
specialty in the knowledge and

77
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,820
how to deploy the assets and
manage, you know, so you know,

78
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,120
make sure everything comes back
safely, to the best of their

79
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,690
ability. And so that together is
what I think really makes the

80
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,370
institute special in its ability
to come up with very challenging

81
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,900
questions, develop the
technology to try and gather the

82
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,450
information that's required in
order to answer those questions.

83
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,430
And then actually go in the
field, gather the data, and and

84
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,100
you know, start working on the
answers. And so that's kind of

85
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,140
like a cycle that we exercise
here pretty regularly. And it's

86
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:12,720
it's all good fun. So I guess
that's the institute is the

87
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,700
that's the answer to in in in a
nutshell.

88
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,590
Audrow Nash: And what kind of
problems are you guys typically

89
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:25,470
like also the in Hewlett
Packard, so Packard set this

90
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,240
foundation, or set this up? So
he received or he sends you guys

91
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,500
a good number, a good amount of
money? To do the research? What

92
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,440
kinds of problems? Are you guys
most interested in? Solving? Or,

93
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,980
like, what what kind of problems
are you going after? I guess,

94
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,310
yeah.

95
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,570
Ben Raanan: So if you walk
around the hall here, you'll

96
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,520
find scientists pretty much any
ocean research discipline that

97
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,660
you can imagine. So we have
geologists, geophysicist,

98
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,880
chemical oceanographers,
biological oceanographers, any

99
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,540
kind of type of marine research
really, that you can imagine, is

100
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:13,380
happening here. And so at the
core, we're trying to describe

101
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,120
the ocean environment and go
after questions that also have

102
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,410
to do with anthropogenic impact,
that's driving change in the

103
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,220
ocean environment,

104
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,510
Audrow Nash: what does that
mean? So generic, is that

105
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:33,660
Ben Raanan: is human generated?
So, yeah, so that really relates

106
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,820
to some of the challenges that
are faced with climate change,

107
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,590
and how emissions for example,
impact our environment. And so,

108
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,250
the ocean is actually a really
important piece and buffering

109
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,140
the heat on the planet. And so,
in order to understand better

110
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,780
the processes that govern heat
transfer, how carbon dioxide

111
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,520
that gets emitted into the
atmosphere is gets absorbed and

112
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,490
back in the ocean and and buried
in the in the ground, that's,

113
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,780
you know, the carbon cycle. So,
the Institute is trying to

114
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,670
target research in order to
acquire data and figure out how

115
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,060
what governs these processes,
what are the rates, and then

116
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,410
through this research inform
larger models that have to do

117
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:28,380
with you know, climate change
and more of a global scale in

118
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:35,730
the global scale sense. So,
those kinds of questions they

119
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,660
really drive research in all the
layers of the ocean. So, from

120
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:46,950
the atmospheric to you know, the
upper water column, where the

121
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:52,440
gases kind of mix and then how
the biology interacts with the

122
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,500
different chemical properties of
the water, different physical

123
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,020
properties of the water, they
take in some of this carbon and

124
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,350
use it to build their bodies
right through photosynthesis,

125
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:12,510
and that later on feeds the
larger organisms and cascades

126
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:18,630
through the foodweb and
eventually, those kind of fix

127
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:24,360
organic compounds are either
pooped out or die and sink to

128
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,320
the bottom of the ocean right
and get buried there. And so

129
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:35,370
that okay, is the carbon cycle
in a nutshell and we focus on

130
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:41,670
research that tries to describe
each of those sections in

131
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,410
detail, and then

132
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,980
Audrow Nash: yeah, gotcha. So,
you have just to see if I

133
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,030
understand the carbon cycle, you
have carbon in the environment,

134
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,760
then you have small like algae
or something, some small things.

135
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,680
that will consume the carbon and
sunlight in this kind of thing

136
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,310
and the photosynthesis happens,
then they go through this whole

137
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:13,290
process where they're eaten by
fish or something. And somehow,

138
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,610
they like eaten by one fish that
small, a bigger fish eats that

139
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:22,230
whatever, eventually something
dies in there. And then it sinks

140
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,380
to the bottom of the ocean. And
what happens when it's at the

141
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,110
bottom of the ocean? It kind of
just stays there for a while.

142
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,470
And you get kind of like, on the
bottom of the ocean, or

143
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:38,010
Ben Raanan: Yeah, so it gets it
gets vented is sediment, and

144
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,830
ocean sea floor, really is, I
guess the storage of that

145
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,660
moment, until, you know, either
gets, then you're starting to

146
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,330
look at geological processes on
you know, what happens there?

147
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:57,150
How? Yeah, so how does the ocean
seafloor evolve over time? And

148
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,850
when does that carbon make it
back into the atmosphere? And so

149
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,800
I guess the point is, yeah, so
we describe a lot. And I guess

150
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,270
the point to really kind of take
away from this is that these are

151
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,650
processes that happen over many,
many, many timescales and over

152
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,940
very different, yeah, are very
different spatial scales as

153
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,770
well. And so at MBARI, we kind
of talk about it in the sense

154
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,310
of, you know, going from
molecules and atoms to

155
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,840
ecosystems and back. And so the
type of science that we do hear

156
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,260
goes from, but understanding the
microbial processes that you

157
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,280
know, what type of nutrients are
required in the ocean in order

158
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:48,720
to make these biological
plankton or bacteria flourish

159
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:55,410
and take in these gases, then,
all the way up to how does it

160
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:02,430
later cascade into the food web?
And what are the timescales that

161
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,120
are associated with those
things, and so that, on its own

162
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,940
poses many challenges, because
in order to collect relevant

163
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,840
information, to describe these
processes, you really have to be

164
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,780
at sea a lot, and have to be
there not only for the duration,

165
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:28,080
but also in the right place, and
cover and span, you know, the

166
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,160
area that's required in order to
to really capture those

167
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,170
fundamentals. So

168
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,730
Audrow Nash: if I understand
correctly, it sounds like you

169
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,480
guys are basically trying to
model so the carbon cycle and

170
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,740
what's occurring to accurately
model that and have a better

171
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:52,590
idea for climate change, you
need to be involved at something

172
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,220
through the whole spectrum,
which is a massive process that

173
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,090
happens everywhere in the ocean,
at all different times, with all

174
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,930
different creatures, there's
lots of things involved. And so

175
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,830
because of this, this makes it
so you guys have a very large

176
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,580
research mission. In a sense,
like, there's a lot of things

177
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,450
that you need to understand, or
there's a lot of monitoring that

178
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:20,640
needs to happen. So that you can
begin to refine your model. So

179
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,300
you can have a good idea of this
process, and maybe its impact,

180
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,060
or maybe its changes over time.
And these kinds of things.

181
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,350
Ben Raanan: Exactly. And the
idea is that eventually, those

182
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,790
type of this type of
information, can cascade into

183
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:42,060
decision makers for conservation
management, and other type of,

184
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,120
you know, decisions that impact
our environment, but also can

185
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,420
affect some of the likelihood,
for example, fishermen, and so

186
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:48,570
on.

187
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,010
Audrow Nash: So that sounds
incredibly lofty as in a huge,

188
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:58,530
huge challenge to basically take
on climate change. Is that

189
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,400
motivating everything at MBARI?
Or are there other problems that

190
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,270
you guys are interested in to?
Like, clearly enormous? And

191
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,910
that's is that everything under
that umbrella? Or are there

192
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,720
other umbrellas?

193
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:12,359
Ben Raanan: Well, there are
other themes as well. I mean,

194
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:15,209
you have researchers here, for
example, that are behavioral

195
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:16,889
ecologists, and they're
interested

196
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,869
Audrow Nash: in I don't even
know what that means at all.

197
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,070
Ben Raanan: Oh, they're, they're
interested in in describing, you

198
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:28,920
know, how certain species behave
under underwater and so. Right?

199
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,920
So you can imagine, for example,
if you're interested in studying

200
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,870
squids, especially if you're
interested in studying DP

201
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:44,700
squids, then, again, getting
access to to the environment

202
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,450
where those squids are, is an
enormous challenge. And one

203
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,930
that's very suited for institute
that is, you know, capable of

204
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,200
developing the technologies and
also executing the operations

205
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:01,170
for getting the right
information and so on. You know,

206
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:05,430
that's another type of research
that we do here. We also have a

207
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:12,420
whole mapping division, we use
vehicles to go in and do surveys

208
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,690
of the ocean seafloor and map
the ocean seafloor, and then

209
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:20,340
return to see how it evolves
over time. So that's a whole

210
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:25,560
kind of branch of geology that
we host here. So really, it's

211
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,650
it's very hard to try to capture
all the activities that go on

212
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:32,580
here and the Institute, I'd say,
climate change has definitely

213
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,200
been one of the main themes and
impacts of climate change on the

214
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,590
ocean environment has been one
of the main themes that have

215
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,620
governed a lot of the proposals
and the projects that have been

216
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,050
here. But it's not the only one,
you know, they're there. Other

217
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,990
projects that, you know, maybe
don't fall exactly under that

218
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,660
umbrella. But that is definitely
the the lead theme.

219
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,840
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. And largely
ocean related. I mean, well,

220
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,740
entirely ocean related, it
sounds and then it's also, I

221
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,350
mean, if you have better ideas
of how these creatures behave,

222
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,500
maybe you have a better idea of
how they are as actors in the

223
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,590
system, which helps you model
these things. And if you have

224
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:14,130
better maps of the environment,
perhaps that also helps you in

225
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:19,380
environmental monitoring, I
could imagine, which will go

226
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,260
back into climate change, in
some sense, because it's such a

227
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,860
large problem, that having an
accurate model has so many

228
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,550
pieces to

229
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,569
Ben Raanan: correct. And then I
guess I'll add that embargo has

230
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:36,299
been a major player, you know,
since the 80s, collecting this

231
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:41,519
information. And so at this
point, we've gathered enormous

232
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,039
quantities of data. And we are
working pretty hard to make this

233
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,569
data available for others to
use, and also process it here

234
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:55,379
and have that multi-decadal
perspective, in order to

235
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:58,289
quantify change in the
environment. So in other words,

236
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,699
we are establishing a baseline
starting, you know, from some

237
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:08,819
point, and looking and observing
how the environment changes over

238
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:12,869
time. And so another big mission
of embargo is to, you know,

239
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:18,419
safeguard this trove of data and
make it accessible. And so I

240
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,939
think that's another thing that
the Institute is unique in its

241
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,939
capacity to offer. So

242
00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:28,919
Audrow Nash: that's really cool.
Now, so that's awesome. What are

243
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,589
some of the ways that you guys
have been using robots and these

244
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:35,039
different parts of kind of the
mission of MBARI?

245
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,140
Ben Raanan: Right, so um, you
know, we refer to oceanography

246
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,920
here as a contact sport, like I
mentioned, in order to gather

247
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,430
the data, you have to be in the
environment. And so as you know,

248
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:54,720
traditionally, oceanography for
decades and has been done using

249
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,230
ships. And that's great. I think
that ships and humans are always

250
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:06,090
going to be part of this type of
research. And inquiry, indeed,

251
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,100
operates to large ships that go
out and collect data and take

252
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,120
expeditions at the sea. But I
think there's also a realization

253
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,030
that, you know, because of these
temporal and spatial scales in

254
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,180
which the phenomenon that we're
interested in studying happen,

255
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,450
we're just not able to

256
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,880
Audrow Nash: get all the clients
to be everywhere all at once,

257
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,090
for sure. So it's much easier to
have robots go do it, for

258
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,950
Ben Raanan: sure. Not
impossible, but it is cost

259
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,520
prohibitive.

260
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,440
Audrow Nash: Yes. But that also
human error and all sorts of

261
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,310
other things, too.

262
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,290
Ben Raanan: Sure. I mean, robots
make mistakes, also, especially

263
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:52,500
people that operate them. So, in
fact, because, you know,

264
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,340
traditionally, this type of
research has been done using

265
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,600
chips. MBARIs also put a lot
of resources into calibrating

266
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,170
the measurements. Okay. So
you've done it collected data,

267
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,770
in a certain way, for a certain
number of years, and now you're

268
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,820
switching into a more automated
collection system. And so how

269
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,960
does that data compare? And what
are the calibration factors that

270
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,640
you need to apply to go from,
you know, manually collected

271
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:25,140
systems into using data that's
collected by automated systems.

272
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,120
And so that's, so making

273
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,140
Audrow Nash: sure that we have
consistency from humans taking

274
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,050
it too. Maybe if you can
automate it and have a robot do

275
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,450
it, you want them to be apples
to apples, not apples to

276
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,710
oranges. So you have this big
break? where the data is, like,

277
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,430
completely different and hard to
draw conclusions from?

278
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,800
Ben Raanan: Exactly. So you
don't suddenly think that

279
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,410
there's, you know, some kind of
climate crisis that happens to

280
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,970
coincide with the time you
started using certain robots. So

281
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,590
so we've been seeing through
this transition. Now, some of

282
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,140
the environments that we
researched which are very hard

283
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,750
to get to. So, for example, kind
of the average ocean depth here

284
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,040
in the Pacific is about four,
four and a half kilometers. So,

285
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,880
so just those are

286
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,250
Audrow Nash: four and a half
kilometers. That 45 football

287
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,230
fields deep, roughly or,

288
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,580
Ben Raanan: rightly so. Yeah.
And a lot of weaker but yeah,

289
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,140
sorry. Yeah, so so so that's
very deep. And when you think

290
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,070
about, for example, the type of
pressure Vironment that we live

291
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:37,050
in. We live at one atmosphere of
pressure, if you go to space,

292
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,960
you're almost at zero. But if
you go about 30 feet down into

293
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,250
water, then you've already
doubled the pressure. And every

294
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,480
30 feet, you add, you add a
whole nother atmosphere. So

295
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,270
Audrow Nash: those many
atmospheres are down there, then

296
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,520
Ben Raanan: we'll have to do the
math.

297
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,400
Audrow Nash: So 4.5 kilometers
down, correct.

298
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:06,270
Ben Raanan: It's one atmosphere
per 10 meters. So if you have

299
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,480
4500 meters, then you'd be at

300
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,270
Audrow Nash: divided by 3030
feet per or 10 meters is one

301
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,770
atmospheric, correct?

302
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,380
Ben Raanan: Yeah. So 450
atmospheres, I believe is the

303
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:22,710
number.

304
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:26,609
Audrow Nash: Yeah, that's an
easy one. Yeah, doing math

305
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:27,809
doesn't always

306
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,510
Ben Raanan: work. But especially
not not. Well, you're being

307
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:30,900
recorded.

308
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,280
Audrow Nash: Not well, sir. So
450 atmospheres?

309
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,730
Ben Raanan: Correct. So I guess
the pressure is immense. And so

310
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,060
in order to take humans into
those kinds of environments, and

311
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:47,100
support life, human life, in
those environments, you know, it

312
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,430
comes with a huge overhead. And
it's not risk free. And there

313
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,940
are systems that do that. You
know, we have deep sea sobs.

314
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,640
Woods Hole Oceanographic, I
believe, operates. Alvin, which

315
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,090
is a human submarine that's able
to go to those kinds of depths

316
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:07,470
and and collecting through
there. But it's really scalable.

317
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,730
And you say,

318
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,520
Audrow Nash: on average, just
average depth is that much,

319
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,030
right? What's the what's the
deepest? Like, I guess we

320
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:19,050
probably don't have a very clear
idea. But what so we do. Okay,

321
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,330
yeah. So how far down does it
go?

322
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,400
Ben Raanan: It's over 11
kilometers. taller than the

323
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,500
mount, the tallest mountain,
right? So and that's 1100.

324
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,100
atmospheres. Correct. And I
believe that's the Mariana

325
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:42,510
Trench, off the coast of Japan,
which is, so yeah, it's pretty

326
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:46,050
deep, but humans have reached
there. And vehicles have gone

327
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,500
down there as well. And so it's
not out of their reach. So it's

328
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,760
not very scalable. Right, I
guess it's the point. And, like

329
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,880
I mentioned, again, a lot of the
phenomenon that we're also

330
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,470
interested in, in studying are
very patchy and episodic in

331
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,830
nature, meaning, you can imagine
the wind blows a certain

332
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,160
direction, the currents do a
certain thing, the nutrients

333
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,910
emerge, and then suddenly, boom,
that creates an opportunity for

334
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,830
something to occur. And you're
either there, or you're not. And

335
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,110
sometimes you can be, I'm sorry,

336
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,690
Audrow Nash: give me an example.
Like what might an event that

337
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:26,280
you're trying to see occur be
like an algae bloom of some

338
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,150
sort, or

339
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,110
Ben Raanan: Yeah, that'd be a
classic example. And so

340
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,540
typically, the way this occurs
is winds blow, they push coastal

341
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:41,370
waters away from shore, and pull
in deeper waters that are much

342
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,230
richer in nutrients. And that
allows for this community to

343
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:52,260
community of microorganisms,
plankton, and phytoplankton, to

344
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:57,810
really flourish. And that mostly
happens on the, you know, upper

345
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,700
part of the ocean where there's
access to sunlight. And so when

346
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,540
those conditions come together,
and those blue dunes are, you

347
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,500
know, you're either there to
catch it, or you're not. And you

348
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,040
either have a platform that's
able to go out and collect this

349
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:19,320
information, or you don't. And
so, I guess, once that window of

350
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,870
opportunity closes, and
typically that's on the order

351
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:28,560
of, yeah, weeks, spanning 10s of
kilometers, at least in the

352
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,270
coastal environment. Yeah, that
then your window of opportunity

353
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:38,220
is is gone and you've lost your
chance to collect the relevant

354
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:43,590
data. And so having having
autonomous platforms that are

355
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:50,190
able to persistently be in the
ocean and collect information is

356
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,950
a huge advantage. And so we kind
of segwayed away from the deep

357
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,860
ocean back, you know, to the
upper water column and we

358
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,000
operate automated In automated
systems in both, but you either

359
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,570
need a very a system that's
capable of operating into depths

360
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,890
and in those deaths, or you need
a system that can operate up in

361
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,260
the water and the upper water
column that's, you know, capable

362
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,580
of having that persistence and
endurance to cover, you know,

363
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:26,190
those, those those areas. And so
in both cases, that those type

364
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:30,660
of problems lend themselves very
well, for automation, and for

365
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:36,720
use of autonomous platforms. And
so MBARI has developed. You

366
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,440
know, at the beginning, we were
very focused on getting to those

367
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,040
steps. And so MBARI was one of
the pioneers in developing

368
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,820
remotely operated vehicles,
there was a big kind of cube

369
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,770
like, vehicles, remotely
operated vehicles are over.

370
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:58,260
Okay. Which, yeah, and so, those
are tethered vehicles, and

371
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,160
they're piloted remotely from a
ship. So those still require a

372
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,460
ship to be in the area. And then
bears

373
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,940
Audrow Nash: able, correct,
yeah, going from the robot to

374
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,430
the ship. Yeah. Yeah, correct.

375
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,480
Ben Raanan: And so in borrowing
has been invested heavily in

376
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,680
developing those kinds of debit
technologies, and also coming up

377
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,700
with ways to manipulate, you
know, the environment there with

378
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:29,610
robotic arms, and so on, so
forth. And then more recently,

379
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:35,220
we focused on using autonomous
vehicles to extend the duration.

380
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:40,680
So cutting the tether, focusing
on platforms that can sustain

381
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,570
themselves in the environment,
with a remote operator that only

382
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:52,110
supervises periodically. And
that really gives you a ability

383
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:57,810
to design without counting on
having a ship in the area. And

384
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:03,930
B, it also opens the window for
scalability, right? So

385
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,890
Audrow Nash: because you don't
need that big stack, to maintain

386
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,980
and be running, like you don't
need a whole ship, going to the

387
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,040
one location because you just
have a bunch of these making

388
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,410
their way around the ocean,
monitoring things

389
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,020
Ben Raanan: correct. And you can
also have an operator that

390
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,200
rather than being fully engaged
in operating a machine is now

391
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,690
checking in periodically just to
make sure things are happening

392
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,240
as they should, and maybe
providing instructions for

393
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,980
correction. And so

394
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:32,130
Audrow Nash: the grocery store
checkout model is everywhere,

395
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,470
these days, for this kind of
thing, where you have like the

396
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:38,520
one person watching the 10
machines that were it's just

397
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,860
it's so interesting to see it
here to where you have one

398
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,280
person kind of supervising, but
not paying attention all the

399
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:50,100
time to all of the robots in
your groups, but just watching a

400
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,680
few that periodically come in
and out of contact, and they

401
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,710
manage maybe giving high level
directions or something like

402
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,380
this. It's so interesting, this
is becoming everywhere, it

403
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:58,890
seems.

404
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:05,400
Ben Raanan: Yeah. And I guess
the so there are some aspects of

405
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,980
doing marine robotics that I
guess they're very different

406
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,450
from terrestrial robots, or
aerial robots in a sense. So I

407
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,940
think, you know, the underwater
environment is a communication

408
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,450
denied. Environment, meaning,
you know, once you go on your,

409
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,720
the radio frequencies that we
use for localization and radio

410
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,060
in between our vehicles
diminishes, at that point, we're

411
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,600
only the only chance to our only
option to communicate with the

412
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,440
vehicles mystically using sound
underwater. And that presents a

413
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,000
whole nother set of challenges.
And that technology has come a

414
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,620
long way. But it's still very
limited, especially compared to

415
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,580
way lower bandwidth

416
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,890
Audrow Nash: I would imagine.
Correct. So you're, you're

417
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,840
talking about far less
information can be sent,

418
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,170
Ben Raanan: right bits per
second, and then three limited

419
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:56,070
in range with typical range, you
know, I'd say a few kilometers,

420
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,510
is kind of typical. Yeah, so So
the vehicles really need to be

421
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,710
self sustained. And they need to
know what to do and operate on

422
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:09,540
their own. And so that that's a
challenge. But at the same time,

423
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,950
you know, as humans, we're not
really able to be in that

424
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:19,620
environment, it's hostile for
our bodies. So any kind of

425
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,550
system they can put out there
and can execute a task that's

426
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,550
useful is going to be an
improvement of what you know, on

427
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:30,120
top of what a person can do. And
I feel here in terrestrial

428
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,350
robotics, we're always up to
your challenge, because, you

429
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:38,910
know, you got to do as well as
something that as well as a

430
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,670
human where you're already in an
environment where humans can

431
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:46,500
function fairly well. So so we
have it, you know, many

432
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:51,030
challenges of one one had but
then, you know, in some, in some

433
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:56,850
ways, it's kind of easier to
make fast progress and push the

434
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,960
needle further than what you
would be able to Have you used

435
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,410
in environments where humans are
capable?

436
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:08,100
Audrow Nash: Yeah, because it's
so cheap. So I'm a little

437
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,300
confused. But it. So you're
saying, because these

438
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,110
environments are so challenging
to get people out there, and

439
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,240
there's budget restrictions and
things because like, you can't

440
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,690
have a ship go to each location
you need, or you're interested,

441
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,200
but you can have a robot that
kind of manages itself much more

442
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,880
cheaply. And so because it's so
hostile, and because of the

443
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,320
scalability problem, there's a
lot of room for advancement with

444
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:39,540
these robots that are going at
the kind of the shallow depths

445
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,280
and monitoring things
autonomously.

446
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,450
Ben Raanan: Correct, or? No?
Yeah, I mean, there's, there's

447
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:49,890
just pretty much any kind of, if
you can get a system to execute

448
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:54,540
any kind of task out there at
sea, you're already pushing the

449
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:59,430
needle forward, you're improving
over what a human can do. And so

450
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,100
and so I guess that's one
advantage of doing marine

451
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,160
robotics, but it might be the
only one, because it really is

452
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,190
very hard. It really is.
Environment.

453
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,630
Audrow Nash: Oh, yeah, totally.
I imagined it's like, almost, if

454
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:17,490
not as difficult as like putting
a robot in that, like, if you

455
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:20,190
put a robot in space, it's like
tremendously difficult to get it

456
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,250
up there. But once it's there,
and it's in a harsh environment,

457
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,520
it's that's a big challenge, for
sure, like putting a rover on

458
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,550
the moon, or putting a rover on
Mars or putting something in

459
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:33,090
space. Like that's tremendously
challenging, given the harshness

460
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,490
of that environment, and that
the remoteness of it. But this

461
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,580
is kind of similar in that the
environments like water is

462
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:43,590
really powerful. It's very cold,
it's very rough. There's like, I

463
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:47,070
don't know, bunch of creatures
all around, I don't know, I'm

464
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:47,610
imagining like,

465
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:52,380
Ben Raanan: we did have vehicles
in the past. So vehicles have

466
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,840
returned with shark bites in
them and teeth embedded in

467
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:01,440
wirings. But that's actually a
really good comparison. But I

468
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,140
guess I would argue that, you
know, because of the pressure

469
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,830
and space versus pressure at
sea, we've already talked about

470
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:12,600
that. So we call that yeah, you
need to be able to sustain those

471
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,570
pressures, which, you know, is a
challenge, but also, even a

472
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:20,220
vehicle on Mars. Sure, you have
a 20 minutes to 20 minutes back

473
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,190
delay in your communication, but
you're still able to communicate

474
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:27,840
with the vehicle at all times.
Versus Right, exactly. Versus

475
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,250
underwater platform, where once
the vehicle is under you

476
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,430
typically lose contact. So yeah,

477
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,000
Audrow Nash: that's very
interesting for that. It's

478
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,840
definitely a very hard problem
space. One thing just to give it

479
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,800
because this is one thing that I
don't quite understand yet. What

480
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,080
kinds of things because these
robots are out there, and

481
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,230
they're monitoring something.
But what kinds of data are they

482
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:55,710
collecting? While they're out
there? Like, specifically? And

483
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,810
I'm sure there's a lot of things
you could look at, but like the

484
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:01,440
nature of the type of data,
you're collecting, something I

485
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,430
don't yet understand?

486
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,000
Ben Raanan: Sure, yeah. So we
have platforms, different

487
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,460
platforms are geared toward
collecting different types of

488
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,390
information. And so if you're
looking at an ROV, that's a

489
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,990
remotely operated vehicle that
has the option to manipulate.

490
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:22,470
And so you little hands, right,
exactly. Okay, so you can do

491
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,430
specimen collection, for
example, at the deep sea. We

492
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:32,310
also use those type of platforms
to do surveys of the seafloor

493
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:40,410
using video multibeam sonars.
And also for mapping and also,

494
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,410
now, LIDAR. And

495
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,690
Audrow Nash: that works under I
mean, I guess it makes sense

496
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,700
that it works underwater. I
imagine there's a new set of

497
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,470
problems and challenges with
that.

498
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,320
Ben Raanan: Yes, it's very
challenging. I'm actually not

499
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,160
working on those projects. But
we have a whole team here that's

500
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:59,040
developing that capability. And
it's pretty cool, actually. Oh,

501
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,890
yeah. So so they've developed
actually this really cool

502
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,100
device. It's, I can share a
video later. But it's an

503
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,090
articulating sled that connects
to the remotely operated

504
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:12,810
vehicle. And it allows the
vehicle to conduct a survey. So

505
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:16,590
you can imagine it flies over a
constant altitude. But then

506
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,130
regardless of how, with the
bathymetry, that's what the

507
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,110
bottom of the ocean. So for
example, now you're coming up

508
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:25,980
against the wall, the sled will
articulate itself. So the

509
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:32,100
sensing is always pointed
directly at the seafloor. And so

510
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,700
that allows you to get
continuous surveys regardless of

511
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,570
what the topography is doing
underwater. And with LIDAR

512
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:44,100
imagery and sonar, you get very
high resolution data. And so you

513
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:49,200
can start describing species to
the genius level using imagery.

514
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,570
Cool. And then by returning to
those points, you're able to

515
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:58,980
track how you know things evolve
over time. And so that's

516
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,220
something we do and Those,
that's one type of information

517
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,550
that we gather and bury those
images and videos that we

518
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:11,580
collect are one of the biggest,
I guess, databases that we have

519
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:16,710
is those videos that these
vehicles collect. And we have

520
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,490
also some projects going on here
now to expose some of that

521
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:23,970
information and make it bring it
to a format where you know, it's

522
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:29,730
right for automation. And so so
that's one type of data, then we

523
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:34,050
have two autonomous vehicles
that also carry those deep sea

524
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:39,510
vehicles. So also geared towards
mapping as a primary task. And

525
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:43,620
they also carry these big
sonars, and are able to do the

526
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:48,810
surveys along the sea bottom, at
depth, and retrieve, you know,

527
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:53,970
high resolution maps of certain
areas. And so that's another

528
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:57,540
type of data that we collect.
And then, in addition to that,

529
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:03,810
we also have what we refer to as
oceanographic sensors. So most

530
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:07,800
typically, there's going to be
sensors that collect

531
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,180
temperature, salinity,

532
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,050
Audrow Nash: you know, that's
how salty it is. Right? Correct.

533
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,190
Second one, salinity,

534
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,550
Ben Raanan: salinity, correct.
And the way Yeah, so that's kind

535
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,480
of like your, your basic, but
then you have also specialized

536
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,450
sensors that are able to tell
you the concentration of certain

537
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,810
nutrients in the ocean water,
for example, like nitrogen,

538
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:34,620
nitrates, sensors, things like
that. And then we also have even

539
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:39,330
more specialized sensors that
are able, for example, to sense

540
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,250
the type of bioluminescence. So
they have a chamber that past

541
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:48,750
Yeah, so so you can see how much
bioluminescence occurring in the

542
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,230
body of water that you're
traveling through. And so that's

543
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,070
another type of

544
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,790
Audrow Nash: does that mean like
an algae will produce light at

545
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,310
night? Or something? I said
analogy, or would it be like

546
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,700
fish in a really deep ocean? Or
both for?

547
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,880
Ben Raanan: Yeah, so they
bioluminescence is light

548
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:12,780
emitting organisms. And so that
actually happens in a very wide

549
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:18,690
range of species across the
entire ocean. So it's pretty

550
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,500
ubiquitous. And we have a lab
here that studies, you know, how

551
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,530
it happens. And what are the
evolution pathways that lead to

552
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:30,180
different types? That's really
cool. Yeah. So so that's another

553
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,200
type of, you know,

554
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,250
Audrow Nash: is it often in deep
sea animals? Or do you see it in

555
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,370
like surface algae? Or like, I
don't know if like the ocean

556
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:41,580
lights up at night? With algae?
I could imagine that. But I

557
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,930
wonder if it's true. No,

558
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:48,120
Ben Raanan: it is true. So
larger organisms that that have

559
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:53,670
bioluminescence are typically
found deeper. And they use

560
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:57,900
bioluminescence for various
reasons, it could be for

561
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,770
attracting a mate for trying to
capture prey for deterring prey.

562
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,130
And you see different patterns
and different colors being used

563
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:10,890
for different purposes. In the
shallower water, there are many

564
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:14,490
types of algae that have
bioluminescence, for different

565
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:19,560
reasons. And we actually have a
project going on here to try and

566
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,390
identify what type of allergy
you're observing just based on

567
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:30,930
the bioluminescence patterns. So
yeah, so it's actually pretty

568
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:34,230
ubiquitous in the ocean and
happens in all kinds of

569
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,670
Audrow Nash: just out of
curiosity, like, I don't really

570
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:42,810
know anything about this, but
why so I can understand animals

571
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:47,940
having bioluminescence? Because
they are, like, as the main

572
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,060
reasons you've mentioned,
hunting, or meeting or something

573
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:55,050
like this, like it's beneficial
for those reasons. But plants. I

574
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:59,220
can't like algae is a plant to
me. And I can't understand like

575
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,590
how that would affect like, if
there's one algae and it has a

576
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:05,280
beautiful glow, it doesn't
probably help that algae meeting

577
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,460
with the other one, or maybe
it's some reactive. What's the

578
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,450
what's the reason why algae has
bioluminescent glows?

579
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,720
Ben Raanan: Well, I don't have a
straight answer. There's

580
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,740
Audrow Nash: many. Yeah,

581
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,530
Ben Raanan: there are probably a
few. It could also be for

582
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:24,480
prediction avoidance. If they
all fluoresce all at once,

583
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,550
Audrow Nash: I guess it looks
like we are waste or something

584
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,090
at some stage.

585
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:32,100
Ben Raanan: If you try to
imagine trying to capture one

586
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,880
little particle, but suddenly, a
light show blows up in front of

587
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,110
you. I think it would be pretty
hard to focus just on one single

588
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:47,130
cell. But I'm not sure that's
really the reason I want to get

589
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:47,730
back into that

590
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,130
Audrow Nash: being some sort of
thing. It's avoiding predators.

591
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:53,820
I just intuitively I don't I
don't have a good model for why

592
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,640
that would be the case. And it's
fascinating that that exists.

593
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:01,350
Ben Raanan: But right, yeah,
yeah. And so Steve haddock, Dr.

594
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:05,730
Steve had a career in MBARI. He
leads research here on

595
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,170
bioluminescence. And so we can
go ahead and look up services

596
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,860
research and probably get some
answers. But he's, he's great.

597
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,900
Audrow Nash: So, those sensors
to your bioluminescence sensors,

598
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,960
and you mentioned a whole bunch
of other ones so salty and

599
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,810
temperature and different
nutrients correctly. So those

600
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:30,840
are the kinds of things you're
collecting data about. And I

601
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,670
guess, also the video one. So if
you if you see an algae bloom,

602
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,150
what kinds of things are you
trying to sense about that, I

603
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:43,860
suppose the nutrients is how
salty it is the temperature, but

604
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,560
then also maybe video of the
event, and then or

605
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:49,650
Ben Raanan: Well, yes, for a
biological shark for studying

606
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,570
those type of microscopic
organisms, we do have some

607
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:59,430
imagery based payloads that we
use in order to try and identify

608
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,180
species.

609
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,890
Audrow Nash: So you mean like
various cameras, camera setup,

610
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,500
or something that you include on
the robot. So you have your

611
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,590
various payloads that have
various sensors that you might

612
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,760
include on your robots,

613
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,970
Ben Raanan: okay. And in
addition to that, we also have

614
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:19,170
the ability to acquire water
samples autonomously at sea. And

615
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,560
so we have a whole lab here,
that's actually, that's their

616
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,960
focus, and they've developed a
payload on the environmental

617
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,100
sample processor. And this is
actually probably the most

618
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,280
advanced type of it's not really
a sensor, but it's more like a

619
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,200
payload we refer to it, it's
able to take in 60 water

620
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,360
samples. So you can imagine some
kind of like, a system that has

621
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:51,000
an intake and is able to filter
water, while the vehicles

622
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,680
deployed at sea. And then also
has some automation that's built

623
00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:01,590
in to this payload, to, you
know, use the right reagents in

624
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:06,900
order to fix fixate that, that
sample. So it doesn't continue

625
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,460
to change after you've filtered
the water. And then that system

626
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,210
also how that would

627
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,150
Audrow Nash: be like if you had
some sort of bacteria in it, or

628
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,930
something that were like
continued to do, whatever. So it

629
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:22,530
like, you'll basically sterilize
everything or kill everything in

630
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,810
it. So you can look at its
components. And then you can

631
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:30,750
easily subtract that reagent out
when you are doing your tests on

632
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:34,590
it. So you know, kind of your
baseline, and you can see what

633
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,240
it was at the time. Ah,

634
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,210
Ben Raanan: exactly correct. And
then these payloads also have

635
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:45,840
some analytical modules that are
able to tell you things about

636
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,920
the sample that you just
acquired at sea. Cool. And so at

637
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,500
the extreme case, and this is
still hasn't been miniaturized

638
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,330
to the point where it runs on a
vehicle, you can run this type

639
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:02,580
of sample and actually target
specific genes. So do almost

640
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,960
like a genomic analysis on the
sample that you just acquired,

641
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,940
and radio back to shore.

642
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,830
Audrow Nash: What are the genes
of what is it literally genes of

643
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,500
something? Are you like getting
an algae sample and looking at

644
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,340
it streams? Or what is it the
what? Oh, it's okay. So it's an

645
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,910
algae that you're synchronizing
effectively. That's super cool.

646
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,520
Ben Raanan: Yeah. And then that
allows you over time and space

647
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,990
to see, you know, what was the?
What was the community, the

648
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:34,740
microbial community? What was it
looking like? And over time, how

649
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,180
is how has it evolved? And that,
you know, is, is really useful

650
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,480
for research and understanding
how things change over time and

651
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:45,690
with conditions. So as
conditions change, how does the

652
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:49,410
microbial community react, but
also, it's very useful for

653
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,990
monitoring. So you can example
for example, you can have, you

654
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,840
can imagine seeing a system like
this deployed somewhere, and

655
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,870
looking for a certain species of
algae that's harmful for the

656
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:01,530
environment, because it produces
some toxin. And that's kind of

657
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:07,320
like an early warning system. So
again, geared toward not only

658
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,980
doing research, but also
conservation and resource

659
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:16,380
management. So that's another
another piece there. And so, you

660
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,680
know, that generally, that
payload kind of personifies, I

661
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,670
guess, one of the major themes
or research that have been going

662
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:26,610
on here at the Institute, which
what we refer to as taking the

663
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:32,970
lab, to see, and being able to
do sample processing, and do as

664
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:38,460
much of the analysis that we can
at sea and inform the vehicle

665
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:44,520
autonomously, on how to proceed.
And so, taking the lab to the

666
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,570
ocean to the sea is has been a
major theme here. And the type

667
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:52,920
of development is also you know,
it's always geared to if you if

668
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,820
you could do it here at sea or
on a ship, how can we take that

669
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:01,080
same analysis and put it on a
platform and so Oh, this, this

670
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:04,140
this water sampling code that it
just described, for example, now

671
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,750
we're at the point where we're
adding these modules that are

672
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:11,070
able to also analyze the samples
and have the vehicle, do this

673
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:14,400
type of analysis at sea, and
radio the results back to shore.

674
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,960
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Okay, so
they radio, the radio the

675
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,850
results back. So this is for
like, one of those surface

676
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:27,450
monitoring robots. So it'll kind
of like stay at some depth,

677
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,920
that's not very deep, collect
some information. And then it

678
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,270
goes in chills at the very
surface in the water, and it'll

679
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,940
radio back the information for
you guys to analyze, or do

680
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,610
something with? And probably
that's how you communicate with

681
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:48,990
it for like, send it commands or
something, as well, right?

682
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,850
Ben Raanan: So yeah, so the
vehicles actually, they can also

683
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:57,420
use on the sensory inputs to
inform their, you know, actions.

684
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:01,620
So our planning algorithms, for
example, that look at sensor

685
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,740
input, and decide how to steer
the vehicle autonomously, for

686
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,580
example, in order to try to stay
with some kind of maximum

687
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:12,960
concentration, where you know,
you're sensing where most of the

688
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,290
algae is, or where the highest
concentration of algae is. And

689
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:21,750
you can use optical sensors, to
try to see how much chlorophyll

690
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:25,320
is in the water using
fluorescence. And so then you

691
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,100
can use this information and
driving the vehicle to do kind

692
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:32,640
of like, you can imagine a
gradient climbing algorithm that

693
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,600
takes a vehicle from a, you
know, an edge and drives it into

694
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,060
center of the patch. And then
when it reaches the center of

695
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,030
patch, it will trigger a water
sample. So that's something that

696
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:47,400
we do here pretty typically. And
then, in addition to that, I

697
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,230
guess you mentioned
communication. So yes, the

698
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:53,400
vehicle surface periodically to
surface with shore. But those

699
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,220
type of applications, especially
if you want to stay with a

700
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:00,420
certain part of the water mass,
meaning, let's say, because

701
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,820
everything is moving in the
ocean constantly, right, you've

702
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:07,620
got currents carrying carrying
these microorganisms. And if you

703
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:13,140
lose that patch of water, and in
order to go up to the surface

704
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,410
and communicate well, when you
come back down, you might be

705
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:20,310
looking at our community. And so
those type of applications

706
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:24,810
really lend themselves well to
multi vehicle constellations.

707
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:30,690
And so that's been another focus
here is this multi vehicle type

708
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:36,420
of operations. And so in the
example that we just discussed,

709
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:41,490
you'll have one vehicle that is
doing this graded climbing and

710
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:45,300
looking for a maxilla. And then
once it finds the highest

711
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,720
concentration of chlorophyll, or
whatever it is, it's looking

712
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:54,390
for, it kind of just parks it
underwater, and stays with that

713
00:47:54,390 --> 00:48:00,180
water mass and drifts. And the
issue with that is, you know,

714
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,180
after a while, you're not going
to know what a vehicle is, you

715
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,090
are not know you're not going to
know what type of information

716
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:10,740
it's looking at. And so a second
vehicle will typically track

717
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:16,170
this type of sampling vehicle,
smart. And then one is at

718
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:19,320
Audrow Nash: the surface looking
down and the other one is

719
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,630
drifting with this algae Max.

720
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,020
Ben Raanan: Well, so that's one
way to do it. And we also use

721
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:27,870
autonomous surface vessels in
order to track underwater

722
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:32,220
assets. But we typically also
have a second underwater vehicle

723
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,160
that's profiling around it and
tracking it, it's surfacing

724
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,120
periodically, and it can relay
information from the diving

725
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:44,190
vehicle. And also, it gives the
scientists more contextual data,

726
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:48,750
because usually the second
vehicle is kind of parked at one

727
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:53,580
little part of the water column.
And in order to get the full

728
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,370
contextual data of what's going
on, you also need a second

729
00:48:56,370 --> 00:49:00,180
vehicle in order to survey and
get

730
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,700
Audrow Nash: the bird's eye view
are the ones in the forest. And

731
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,200
one is that the trees kind of
thing.

732
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,650
Ben Raanan: Exactly. And so
multi vehicle applications have

733
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:11,880
been, you know, a main theme
here. And I guess that kind of

734
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:17,550
leads us toward maybe talking a
little bit about the sim. Yeah,

735
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,670
Audrow Nash: one sec. Just
before we go into that, what are

736
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:24,060
these vehicles look like? So
specifically talking about the

737
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:28,530
surface monitoring ones where
we're looking at algae, right?

738
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:30,480
What are the what are the robots
look like?

739
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:35,099
Ben Raanan: Yeah, so typically,
they're kind of torpedo shaped

740
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:40,259
vehicles. That's the most
efficient way. And the vehicles

741
00:49:40,259 --> 00:49:44,549
that we work that I work with,
specifically are kind of small

742
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:49,289
size, so they're probably two to
two and a half meters long,

743
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:53,429
depending on the type of payload
that they have. And the diameter

744
00:49:53,429 --> 00:49:58,829
is about 12 inches. And there it
basically looks like torpedoes,

745
00:49:59,279 --> 00:50:02,699
I can show you A picture here
maybe? Sure.

746
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:07,109
Audrow Nash: I'd love to talk a
little bit about how they work

747
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:10,439
and then get into the SIM stuff.
Because the sim stuff is very

748
00:50:10,439 --> 00:50:12,089
interesting. For sure.

749
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,780
Ben Raanan: So this is a picture
of one of our vehicles, those

750
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:20,430
are test class long range EVs.
So, like I mentioned, these are

751
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:23,790
upper water column vehicles,
they're pressure rated for about

752
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:27,090
300 meters. And what's special
about them is really their

753
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,430
endurance, we decided to

754
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:30,690
Audrow Nash: fire extinguisher,

755
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,740
Ben Raanan: pretty much, yeah,
if you ever seen a picture of it

756
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:40,440
there, then it looks pretty much
like that with a bit with a mask

757
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:46,830
on top, and that's our
communication antenna. Yeah, so

758
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:53,310
go ahead, stop sharing it. But
so that's the long end up now. I

759
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:57,120
guess, like I mentioned, we
embark has really been on the

760
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,690
forefront of development of
these platforms. And so on that

761
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:04,020
vehicle that I just showed that
this class long SUV has been

762
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,990
developed and borrowed from
scratch. And it's also

763
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:10,500
manufactured here, and operated
here. And so everything about

764
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:15,570
that vehicle was designed here
in house, these vehicles are

765
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:18,510
special, they're special in
their capacity for their high

766
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:21,600
endurance vehicles, meaning they
can cover about 1500 kilometers.

767
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:27,240
And stay at sea for say, up to
two to three weeks, which is

768
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:32,550
unusual for vehicles at that
size. Especially for ones that

769
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:37,620
have propeller and they're able
to thrust on their own. There

770
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:41,280
are other types of vehicles that
don't have thrusters and have

771
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:44,970
longer endurance. But this
vehicle is very special and

772
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:48,810
unique. And that's capacity to
stay up there.

773
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:52,470
Audrow Nash: So it doesn't do
any, it basically you have a

774
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:57,900
battery, and that battery will
last for two to three weeks. And

775
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,630
that dictates how long you can
do it doesn't do any power

776
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:04,650
generation or like go up to the
surface and have solar panels

777
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:05,520
fold out or

778
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:10,530
Ben Raanan: something. But it
does. I mean, the power

779
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:15,420
management system is very
efficient, efficient. Yes, every

780
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:17,970
every aspect of that vehicle is
designed is really geared toward

781
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:22,350
efficiency from the shape to the
tail cone and how you know, the

782
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:26,850
the hydrodynamic flow, and how
water passes around it. It's

783
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:30,300
going to set to minimize drag.
And this vehicle specifically is

784
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:34,920
also special because it can
change its buoyancy. Meaning it

785
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:37,560
most people that put very
expensive pieces of equipment in

786
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:42,000
the ocean, they make them
buoyant. So if the agent stops

787
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,360
working, we'll come back up.
Well, this one is able to

788
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:51,120
actually change its buoyancy at
sea and fly neutral. And that

789
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,970
actually gives you a huge
efficiency boost, because you're

790
00:52:53,970 --> 00:53:01,710
not pushing against. Yeah, this
upward force. And so then, you

791
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:04,140
know, comes the question, okay,
if something does go wrong, how

792
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,530
do you manage that, and so their
safety and power management are

793
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:13,590
kind of the heart of this
vehicle. And so both both have,

794
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,440
you know, systems that are
designed specifically in order

795
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:21,750
to optimize the routers, the
vehicle powers off systems

796
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:25,080
automatically when it doesn't
need them, even including extra

797
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:30,690
readers. So it's very smart
management on board. And, you

798
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:33,780
know, when you you know,
insurance in general, it's kind

799
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:38,700
of death by 1000 cuts, right?
Try to optimize around each

800
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,880
parameter, eventually, you get a
system that is able to persist

801
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,210
and be out there for those type
of durations. And again, the

802
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:47,700
requirements for those durations
come back to the original

803
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:51,540
processes that we've discussed
kind of in depth upon not

804
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:51,870
intended.

805
00:53:53,909 --> 00:53:59,969
Audrow Nash: So many ocean ponds
are possible for sure. So with

806
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:02,819
this, when it adjusts its
buoyancy, the way it does that

807
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:05,429
is it takes on water, right,
like so it will have little

808
00:54:05,429 --> 00:54:08,189
cavities or something in it, or
how does it work?

809
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:12,810
Ben Raanan: Yeah, well,
actually. So our vehicle doesn't

810
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:20,940
take in water, it uses oil. And
so it can pass oil into a

811
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:26,910
bladder that's external to the
sealed compartment. And by doing

812
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:29,970
that, so if you're taking oil
from the sealed compartment, and

813
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:32,670
pushing it out to a bladder that
can inflate, you're actually

814
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:35,670
changing the volume of the
vehicle without changing its

815
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:39,690
mass. And by definition, that
makes it more buoyant. And when

816
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:43,950
you want to become less buoyant,
you just push the oil back into

817
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:48,240
the seal compartments. And that
deflates the bladder. And the

818
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:48,930
vehicle

819
00:54:49,469 --> 00:54:53,099
Audrow Nash: then becomes less
of a thing. The volume changes

820
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:56,609
in the mass stays constant and
that changes the buoyancy of the

821
00:54:56,609 --> 00:54:59,969
correct Is it is it a lot of
energy to like compress the oil

822
00:54:59,999 --> 00:55:04,829
Remove it inside to the oil.
What?

823
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,200
Ben Raanan: It's not oil, it's
not cool. It's non compressible

824
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,590
oil.

825
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,890
Audrow Nash: It's like some sort
of vacuum thing to move it from

826
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,030
one spot to another.

827
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:15,960
Ben Raanan: Yeah, we have a
valve that opens and then a pump

828
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:19,260
that sits inside the seal
compartment and can push oil

829
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:23,790
outside. And it's designed in a
way that, you know, it can push

830
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:31,980
against pressure, even at depth.
And then there's a lot of also

831
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,640
some safety built in there, you
know, what happens if suddenly

832
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,100
you can't push against the
pressure. And so there are some

833
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:41,580
valves that are set to close
automatically and make sure that

834
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:46,980
water never makes it back. In in
case of a failure. So like I

835
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:53,640
said, failure management is one
of the big things. Exactly. So

836
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:57,510
pretty much every aspect here.
Yeah. Go ahead. So.

837
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:01,019
Audrow Nash: So you don't want
it to fail, because you lose

838
00:56:01,019 --> 00:56:05,999
your robot. How much does one of
these robots actually cost? Like

839
00:56:05,999 --> 00:56:06,659
ballpark?

840
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,380
Ben Raanan: Yeah, sure. So I
guess these vehicles also, were

841
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:18,990
designed for what we refer to as
science users. Okay. So if

842
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:22,440
you're a researcher at a lab,
you should be able to buy one of

843
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,610
these and, and, and operate it
on your own with a reasonable

844
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:28,890
budget. And so that was kind of
the requirements going into

845
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:35,280
there. And so the vehicles, you
know, they're well, actually,

846
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,300
not sure if it's a good idea for
me to disclose the exact

847
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:44,610
Audrow Nash: like, like an order
of magnitude $50,000 robot

848
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:45,240
platform, I'd

849
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,860
Ben Raanan: say probably an
order of magnitude more.

850
00:56:47,969 --> 00:56:52,319
Audrow Nash: Wow. So it's like
ballpark 500,000. So half a

851
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,699
million almost for one of these.
Yeah. And that's affordable for

852
00:56:56,699 --> 00:56:59,129
large research institutions. I
take it well, if

853
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:05,460
Ben Raanan: you consider what it
costs to operate a ship. Yeah,

854
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:05,790
most of

855
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:09,030
Audrow Nash: it costs in order
to do a ship, like right, so I

856
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:13,320
guess, sorry, go ahead, because
it seems expensive. But I have

857
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:17,490
no experience in this. So no
real ability to estimate this.

858
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,860
Ben Raanan: Right. So a big
ship, especially one that can

859
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:23,820
operate an ROV, you're probably
looking at a few tenths of

860
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:30,030
$1,000 per day. Wow. So if it's
a bigger ship, you're around 50

861
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:36,000
to 60k. Easy per day of
operation. And so half a

862
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,230
million. I mean, it might sound
a lot, but when you think about

863
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:45,390
it, and ship. Exactly. And so
that's the idea, then, once you

864
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:50,580
if you can get the costs in for
the vehicle, the operational

865
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:53,730
costs are very, very cheap. You
can deploy these vehicles with,

866
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:58,980
you know, tiny, little boats,
and then you're stuck with the,

867
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:01,650
you know, whatever
communications bill for radium

868
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:07,380
satellite communication, or you
know, your, your 4g cell. So,

869
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:11,250
Audrow Nash: so they the
operational origin is, so if

870
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:15,960
they're doing, like 4g cell
service for transferring data,

871
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:21,990
does that mean that you have to
stay close to coast with these?

872
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:23,940
And that's typically how you're
using them? Because I would

873
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:27,180
imagine if you're in the middle
of the ocean, like very far from

874
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,580
shore, you're in the middle of
the Pacific. There's no cell

875
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,890
towers out there. There's no
cell service, but you did

876
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:34,980
mention satellite. So I suppose
you could use that?

877
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:38,820
Ben Raanan: Yeah. So we have, we
refer to the we have two modes

878
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:44,190
of operation. We, when you're
outside of cell range, we refer

879
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:47,760
to that as over the horizon.
When you're within cell range,

880
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:50,730
you know, why not take advantage
of cell communication and do big

881
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:54,870
data dumps when you can? I don't
know if a region is very slow,

882
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,210
and bandwidth limited, and so

883
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,600
Audrow Nash: slow is really
slow, like ballpark.

884
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:05,760
Ben Raanan: So let's see to read
the impact it is 340 bytes. And

885
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,420
you get about I'd say if you're
lucky, three to four per minute.

886
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:15,450
When the surface Yes, so it's
tiny. And so we play a lot of

887
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:19,470
games on board system, with
refreshing, and all sorts. Yeah,

888
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,470
and also not only compression,
but also selecting what

889
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,320
information to send what's the
most relevant piece of

890
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,870
information that needs to be
sent? What needs to be sent

891
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:31,380
first versus, you know, if
you're only able to get one SBD?

892
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,230
One ready, pack it out? You
know, what is it going to be?

893
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:38,580
And so, we work a lot with the
scientists in order to

894
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:42,720
understand the use case. You
know, get what is the crucial

895
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,640
information that they need for
decision making while the

896
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,910
vehicles deployed and then
configure the vehicle

897
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:52,620
appropriately and send it over?
And, you know, hopefully not

898
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:56,190
spend most of our time sitting
on the surface sending packets

899
00:59:56,190 --> 01:00:01,080
data. Exactly. So time on the
surface is rescue vehicle

900
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:04,710
because it can get over. That's
probably the biggest risk for

901
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:06,060
these autonomous platforms

902
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,540
Audrow Nash: getting run over.
Not sharks. Yeah. All right.

903
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,050
Ben Raanan: But so it's time not
doing science. So totally.

904
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:21,960
Audrow Nash: Okay, so you have
these, what have you long range?

905
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:26,340
What was the next part?
autonomous underwater vehicles?

906
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:27,960
Or what was the thing you were
saying? Correct?

907
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:31,230
Ben Raanan: Yes, it's the long.
So these, these vehicles are

908
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,610
long range autonomous underwater
vehicles. So LR EVs for short.

909
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:42,210
Audrow Nash: LR UVs? LR LR UVs.
Yeah. doesn't roll off the

910
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:42,870
tongue terribly.

911
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,650
Ben Raanan: You know, we've had
other people try to come up with

912
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:50,520
different ways. We're kind of
stuck with that one.

913
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:53,130
Audrow Nash: Okay, I'm just
gonna say long range underwater

914
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:57,660
vehicles easier. Okay, so you
have these, Whoa, you're

915
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:01,080
mentioning that you have a bunch
of safety precautions on them?

916
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,410
Because so they're half a
million dollar platforms. I'm

917
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:07,800
sure that with the cost of about
you make the money back, but

918
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,280
it's still super expensive. So I
think institutions probably

919
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,940
wouldn't like to be replacing
them because they keep getting

920
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:20,250
lost at sea, literally. Right.
Can you talk about about the

921
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:20,670
safety?

922
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:25,050
Ben Raanan: So I guess I'll say
that we have eight of these

923
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:29,340
platforms here in MBARI. And
there are others coming up

924
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:33,660
online. I was holding on other
places where they're building at

925
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:39,180
the moment. And between the
fleet, we have probably nearing

926
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:45,690
35,000 hours of sea time. And
seems like that's a lot. That's

927
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,230
a lot.

928
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:50,310
Audrow Nash: Let's see, how many
how many days at sea is that

929
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:56,730
between the eight? So that's
1000 divided by 24. Right?

930
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:01,560
Ben Raanan: So So that's like,
four years? Four years worth of?

931
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:06,720
Yeah, it's four years of sea
time, which isn't crazy. That's

932
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:12,420
a lot. And dirt. Exactly. I was
gonna go knock on wood. But

933
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:18,600
yeah, right. We've never lost
one. Yeah. And so, again, the

934
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:22,290
reason is, because MBARI has a
lot of experience. And we've

935
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,750
basically taken all of our
experience and knowledge and

936
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:28,290
built it into the hardware level
of these vehicles. So this

937
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:32,850
vehicle has so many safety
features built into it. In the

938
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:36,690
hardware level, meaning the
motherboard itself, if CPU

939
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:42,150
fries. The motherboard itself
has the capacity to turn on the

940
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:47,490
radio and communicate, you know,
so you know, fire up a device

941
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:52,170
that drops a weight to make the
vehicle positively Oh stays and

942
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:55,680
we have an emergency, it's
going? Well, no, it will come

943
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,800
back to the surface. The drop
weight, attaches

944
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:01,410
Audrow Nash: reduces the weight.
And so it goes exactly, yeah,

945
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,690
it's like cutting your weights
when you're scuba diving. So

946
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:05,190
that exam you can start going
on.

947
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,670
Ben Raanan: And that's exactly
the idea. And then we have

948
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:12,300
transponders and all kinds of
other acoustic devices onboard

949
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:16,050
the vehicle, and then emergency
beacons, so we can, we can

950
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:20,070
always find them. So the vehicle
will try as hard as it can to

951
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:22,560
come back to the surface because
that's where it can be located.

952
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,230
And once it's on the surface,
even if the battery is

953
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:31,800
completely depleted, their
secondary radio, right, that

954
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,370
will that will communicate with
shore and send its position. And

955
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:41,700
so that's one aspect. We also
have very sophisticated ground

956
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,760
fault detection systems,
meaning, you know, if, if

957
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,620
there's a cable or something
like that that's exposed to

958
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:50,160
ocean water, that can cause
corrosion, that can cause

959
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,480
corrosion, just because Victor
city starts interacting with

960
01:03:54,810 --> 01:04:00,120
different parks like the whole.
And so we have a very strict

961
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:04,740
monitoring system for that. We
also have, you know, in general,

962
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:08,190
you want the system to be
reliable and fault tolerant. So

963
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:10,800
you can continue to do
operations, if the vehicle has

964
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,080
to surface every 10 minutes,
because if you've countered an

965
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,230
issue that it can't resolve on
its own, well, operationally,

966
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:19,770
that doesn't scale. And so we
have also a health monitoring

967
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:24,390
system on board that's able to
power cycle different subsystems

968
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:29,250
and try to change balls. And so
yeah, a lot of thought and

969
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:32,400
effort has gone into making sure
that the system will keep doing

970
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,970
what it's supposed to do for as
long as it can, and only come

971
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,710
back to the surface and
communicate with sure when it

972
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:38,550
absolutely has to.

973
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:41,610
Audrow Nash: Gotcha Awesome.
That's so funny that it power

974
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:45,390
cycle, all the things. It's just
it's like that tried and true

975
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:48,600
wisdom of just like if it's not
working, just power cycle it. I

976
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,020
love that you have the ability
to do that, kind of remotely

977
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:53,520
with the robot, right?

978
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:56,640
Ben Raanan: Yeah, it'd be a step
forward or it would flip RX and

979
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,120
TX.

980
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,360
Audrow Nash: And because of
that, so just to explain, if

981
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,690
anyone didn't get it, it's the
transmit and receive wires. So

982
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:08,760
like a lot of times when you're
building stuff you mix up, which

983
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,820
is the transmitting and
receiving the flip, it all works

984
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:14,550
magically. Right. So that would
be so funny.

985
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:17,280
Ben Raanan: Yeah, that's kind of
like the classic mistake. But

986
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,090
yeah. So with all that, and we I
guess, I also say that we've

987
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:24,630
operated these vehicles now in
both Pacific and Atlantic

988
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:29,010
oceans, and also in the Great
Lakes. So their tried and true

989
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:32,490
vehicles. very persistent, very
reliable.

990
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,760
Audrow Nash: So and you
mentioned you have eight of

991
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:40,260
them. That's, I mean, that's
that's in between them, they

992
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:43,890
have tons and tons of hours, is
there a plan to like scale it

993
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:48,660
massively and get like 80 of
them, or 800 of them? Or, like,

994
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:51,780
so these are all over monitoring
everything all at once? Or?

995
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,800
Well? Yeah, where do you see
this going in the future?

996
01:05:55,830 --> 01:06:00,660
Ben Raanan: Right. And so I
guess, you know, we're currently

997
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:06,000
I think doing multi Vehicle
Operations, has still a lot of

998
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,050
overhead. And so figuring out, I
guess, at first order how to

999
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:14,400
operate so many vehicles, in
conjunction, and how to automate

1000
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:17,850
the processes, ongoing research
on MBARI, and I think in a lot

1001
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:24,480
of other places, we've nailed
down two to three fleets of two

1002
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,300
or three and doing
collaborative, multi vehicle

1003
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:31,200
operations at sea. With you
know, that many vehicles, more

1004
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,350
than that, you start running
into bottlenecks. For example,

1005
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:38,100
if they're all using the same
acoustic channel to communicate,

1006
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:42,120
well, that's kind of like a
habit, right? Only one person

1007
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,680
can talk at any time. And so you
get where

1008
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,440
Audrow Nash: you say, You're,
like, I'm talking to this one,

1009
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,450
and then the message, but it's
inefficient.

1010
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:52,800
Ben Raanan: Right, exactly. So
so that's another piece where we

1011
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,650
have some ongoing research, to
figure out how we can scale

1012
01:06:55,650 --> 01:07:00,150
that. But then also, the
logistics of operating a fleet

1013
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:05,190
like that is also you know, so
you have two weeks of battery,

1014
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:09,330
and you need to if you have many
of those, they really need to be

1015
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:11,550
self sustained. And XE is

1016
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,160
Audrow Nash: some sort of power
generation method.

1017
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:18,690
Ben Raanan: Correct. And so
Barbie has an ongoing project,

1018
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:24,540
we have a, what we call the
energy booty to it's, it's a boy

1019
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:31,920
that uses energy from waves. And
so that charges a battery, and

1020
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:32,910
then in conjunction with

1021
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:35,340
Audrow Nash: that, so is it kind
of like it rides along like

1022
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:39,000
maybe six feet down, or
something, and then there's the

1023
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,540
buoy moving up and down,
creating motion, and then you're

1024
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,700
using metal icicle energy, this

1025
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:48,059
Ben Raanan: is a whole separate
platform that generates power.

1026
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:51,689
And then I was gonna say, and
then in addition to that

1027
01:07:51,689 --> 01:07:55,079
platform, it also has what we
refer to as a docking module.

1028
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:58,949
And so the idea is for the
vehicles to be able to home back

1029
01:07:58,979 --> 01:08:04,049
to this device, dock on it, and
charge the battery. And we've

1030
01:08:04,049 --> 01:08:07,859
made some really good progress.
So we have a boy that, you know,

1031
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:13,019
manufactures energy from waves,
and stores it. And now we've

1032
01:08:13,019 --> 01:08:16,199
been, we, we've actually
licensed some technology from

1033
01:08:16,379 --> 01:08:20,939
Northrop Grumman. And they've
developed this technology they

1034
01:08:20,939 --> 01:08:27,239
call Niobe, calm, which is this
metal that's based on niobium,

1035
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:31,679
that is self healing. So it can
coat itself with a very thin

1036
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,539
layer that doesn't transfer
electricity. And so it interacts

1037
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:39,449
when when you power it in
interacts with seawater, and it

1038
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:43,169
creates this coat round the
metal. And so that's kind of

1039
01:08:43,169 --> 01:08:45,089
like a self sustained piece of
equipment that you could leave

1040
01:08:45,089 --> 01:08:48,899
in the ocean. And then when the
vehicle comes in docks on it, it

1041
01:08:48,899 --> 01:08:53,279
could expose and just peel off
that tiny little thin layer, and

1042
01:08:54,329 --> 01:08:58,469
in connect to the power source
in charge its battery. And so

1043
01:08:58,469 --> 01:09:04,319
we've been working very hard to,
you know, see that through, and

1044
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:06,989
we've done some sea trials, and
you know, it works, there's

1045
01:09:06,989 --> 01:09:09,809
still a lot of kinks to iron,
but that's for sure, no,

1046
01:09:09,809 --> 01:09:14,459
eventually, the the dream is to
be able to have a large number

1047
01:09:14,459 --> 01:09:18,209
of these vehicles out at sea
where they circulate in common,

1048
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:20,699
charge their battery, do data
dumps and then go back out to

1049
01:09:20,699 --> 01:09:26,129
sea. And then you can even
imagine maybe that wave we is

1050
01:09:26,129 --> 01:09:28,709
something that's mobile, and
maybe you can direct that thing

1051
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:34,199
in ordinance. And so I think
that type of constellation,

1052
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:40,079
where you have an energy source
in a in a data sink, where you

1053
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:42,659
know, vehicles can come in and
charge the battery and do big

1054
01:09:42,659 --> 01:09:47,669
data off floats and then go back
and do tasks. Is is kind of

1055
01:09:47,669 --> 01:09:50,069
where we're headed with this,
what we refer to as kind of like

1056
01:09:50,069 --> 01:09:51,749
a mobile observation platform.

1057
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:56,280
Audrow Nash: And then once you
have that, then scaling is a lot

1058
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,490
easier. It's like maybe the two
hardest challenges for this

1059
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:03,030
would be the communication as
part of this, where you're

1060
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:08,070
limited and how you can send to
multiple ones. And also you're

1061
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,800
very limited by satellite radio,
I wonder if like Starlink, or

1062
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,430
anything will help any of that.
That'd be quite cool. No, no.

1063
01:10:15,809 --> 01:10:17,669
Ben Raanan: Yeah, there are
still other technologies that

1064
01:10:17,669 --> 01:10:22,349
are coming up, that will speed
up over the horizon.

1065
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:26,129
Communication. So we're excited
to see how this technology is

1066
01:10:26,129 --> 01:10:26,489
gonna play

1067
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:28,620
Audrow Nash: out, that'd be
super cool. And then the second

1068
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:32,340
one would be power generation,
because you have to retrieve it

1069
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:36,330
after the battery is nearly
dead, or around the time that

1070
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:40,110
the battery's nearly dead. But
if you could somehow charge with

1071
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,930
these systems, or whatever it
might be, then you could just

1072
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:46,500
stay out and continuously
revolve them. And then it's a

1073
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:51,090
lot less going out and grabbing
it, which I assume is still

1074
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:53,880
quite expensive to do, because
you need to take a ship. And the

1075
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,640
ship has to have like a big
crane or something to grab it or

1076
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,420
whatever it might be.

1077
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,810
Ben Raanan: Sure. And I mean,
you don't assume for these

1078
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:03,990
vehicles, you don't necessarily
have to have it. Yeah, but But

1079
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:06,240
if they're far out, I mean, if
you're in a coastal environment,

1080
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:09,960
that's great. But if, if it's
happening, if you want to do

1081
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:13,950
research for that, or if it's
really just really far away.

1082
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:18,840
That's an issue. Yeah. And so
we're also looking into

1083
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,680
developing autonomous surface
vessels that are able to do

1084
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:26,520
deployment and tow out, that'd
be so cool. Yeah. So that's

1085
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:30,420
another kind of direction that
some researchers here are

1086
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,500
looking at at the moment.

1087
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:35,760
Audrow Nash: You mentioned
earlier that one human operator

1088
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,910
can work with a few different of
these robots that are out how

1089
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:39,540
does that look?

1090
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:45,810
Ben Raanan: Yeah, so we've put a
lot of effort into developing a

1091
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,350
user interface, that's a web
based interface that allows you

1092
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:53,280
to control the fleet and
interact with it. And so we

1093
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:58,230
basically have a website that
gives you all the information

1094
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:00,660
you need in order to operate the
vehicles tells you where they

1095
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:04,770
are to you on a map, to see what
mission they're running, and

1096
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:07,560
you're able to interact and
queue up commands and send them

1097
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:13,020
to the vehicles through that web
interface. Like I said, the

1098
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:17,430
vehicles were, you know, really
designed with the end user in

1099
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:22,170
mind. So when we have big
expeditions and experiments out

1100
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:25,470
here, the scientists are the
ones that are actually running

1101
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,920
the vehicles and not the
engineers. And so we have a

1102
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:32,550
training program that we, you
know, developed in order to

1103
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:35,790
train people to use them with
our web interface. And we

1104
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:39,780
actually have a number of
projects here that are geared

1105
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:43,740
toward, you know, improving the
user experience, and, and

1106
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:47,370
rethinking a little bit how we
can do these types of multi

1107
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:51,240
vehicle operations. With a
single user kind of commanding

1108
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:56,730
the fleet, again, doing 234.
That's definitely manageable

1109
01:12:56,730 --> 01:13:00,270
with a single operator. But more
than that, I think it'd be a bit

1110
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:06,060
of an overload. A lot of ends up
being, you know, what we're

1111
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:10,020
identifying the bottleneck is
the ability to predict what is

1112
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:12,330
going to happen next, the how
the schedule is going to work

1113
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:16,140
together, how missions. So
basically, look into the future

1114
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:19,020
and understand what what, what
are the next few steps that the

1115
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:22,770
fleet is going to do? Currently,
it's easy to understand what's

1116
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:25,020
happening at the moment, but
it's a little harder to

1117
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:28,650
understand, you know, how things
are going to evolve. And so

1118
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,490
that's another piece where we're
trying to add in, you know,

1119
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:37,740
models that are maybe a way to
extrapolate out into the near

1120
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:40,650
future, at least, and give the
operator an idea of what the

1121
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:43,920
fleet's going to be doing, not
only what it's doing at the

1122
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:44,700
moment. So,

1123
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:49,020
Audrow Nash: gotcha. Awesome.
It's very interesting. It's

1124
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:53,250
cool. It's cool to imagine
scaling this, I don't know, it's

1125
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:56,220
really neat to me to have an
operator controlling these at a

1126
01:13:56,220 --> 01:14:00,600
high level and making the plans
and it's neat to consider how

1127
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,540
that interface might be and how
it'll change over time as you

1128
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:07,140
increase the efficiency for an
operator. Very cool.

1129
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:12,360
Ben Raanan: Yeah. And I guess,
you know, because the timescales

1130
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:14,940
we're talking about, for these
vehicles for their deployments,

1131
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,790
I mean, that's weeks
potentially, doing development

1132
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:21,000
on the system is very difficult,
because once they go to the,

1133
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:24,750
there's a lot of overhead,
everything's very slow, and so

1134
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:28,680
fast. And then real time
simulation really plays heavily

1135
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:35,040
into what we do. And so I feel
like, you know, I think that

1136
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,130
having those capabilities also,
especially in the fleet context,

1137
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:41,670
are going to be monumental into
developing disabilities to not

1138
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:44,760
only do the multi vehicle
operations at sea, but also how

1139
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:47,100
to control them. So

1140
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:51,030
Audrow Nash: that's tell me a
bit about the simulation. Right.

1141
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:56,010
Ben Raanan: So this project is
something that we jumped up a

1142
01:14:57,090 --> 01:15:01,920
couple of years ago. It's The
idea was, you know, we talked a

1143
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:06,750
lot about multi vehicles, and
how difficult Axi operations are

1144
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:10,950
and risky. And so the idea was
to develop in a development

1145
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:17,400
environment for these vehicles
that will allow us to test and

1146
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,070
the closest way to the
conditions that we experienced

1147
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:24,480
out at sea, you know, the, the
challenges and the bottlenecks

1148
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:30,360
for these types of operations.
And so, we had a simulator that

1149
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:34,740
was built in that we developed
the system. But we felt like it

1150
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:39,150
was time for a facelift. So it
wasn't really I mean, it's a

1151
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:43,740
command line tool. So it didn't
really scale well, to the motor

1152
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:48,450
vehicle scenario. And so we
looked at a few options of you

1153
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:53,670
know, what it would take to
upgrade it. And eventually, we

1154
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:56,730
came up with this idea, maybe we
should, you know, bring in an

1155
01:15:56,730 --> 01:15:59,790
external platform, and we
started looking around. And

1156
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:04,050
that's when we came across a
gazebo and a condition. And we

1157
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:09,540
also had some folks who opened
robotics come here and visit and

1158
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:12,810
started forming these
relationships. And so from here

1159
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:17,760
to there, we decided to launch
this project to build a multi

1160
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:23,670
vehicle underwater simulation
environment for LR UV in gazebo,

1161
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:26,820
and ignition. And we got funded
through the Institute in order

1162
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:29,610
to do exactly that. And we
partnered with open robotics,

1163
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:35,040
and really contracted the
engineering time to do the

1164
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:39,660
development for this purpose.
And so it's been a fun ride,

1165
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:47,550
working with the team here at
open robotics. You know, we had

1166
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:50,910
some, we weren't really sure how
it was gonna work out, we

1167
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:54,570
absolutely had to have the
framework work with the flight

1168
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:58,470
code of the vehicles themselves.
Typically, ignition is geared

1169
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:02,430
more toward applications that
use Ross, where our vehicles run

1170
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:05,130
such tiny embedded systems that
at the time, it wasn't really

1171
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:09,300
possible to even get Ross loaded
on it. And so the integration

1172
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:13,350
with our software was key. And
so we focus on that. And then

1173
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:15,720
the second biggest requirement
was the fast in real time

1174
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,930
capability. And so we also had
concerns with that. And that was

1175
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,450
part of the reasons why. So we
went to ignition or gazebo

1176
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:24,690
classic, is the runtime is much
quicker, and you can change

1177
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:30,060
different aspects of the system
to expedite the runtimes. And so

1178
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:32,910
we started with integration
built the vehicle model for L or

1179
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:37,950
u v, which is now available to
download an app fuel and we can

1180
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:41,430
incorporate the links maybe at
the bottom here, when we're

1181
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:47,820
done. And, and so we slowly
started building the the pieces

1182
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:51,960
and the different plugins that
were required. A big piece that

1183
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,230
we recently completed was kind
of like custom sensor

1184
01:17:55,230 --> 01:18:00,420
environmental data. So your
ability to take detailed

1185
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:05,010
information from, you know, very
sophisticated models that model

1186
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:07,890
circulation and temperatures and
you know, all the different

1187
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,820
ocean parameter, as well as the
biological activity that that

1188
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:16,560
relates to those conditions, and
inject those into the system and

1189
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,970
how the vehicles operate within
that environment that not only

1190
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:24,570
has, you know, the water
properties, and waves and wind

1191
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:27,810
and all those things, but it
also has kind of scientific

1192
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:31,890
sensor data that the vehicle
would encounter, as if it's in

1193
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:35,760
the field. And so that's a
really nice aspect of the system

1194
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:38,640
that I feel we've done a little
bit different from the way

1195
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,330
things are more traditionally
done, where you have kind of

1196
01:18:42,330 --> 01:18:45,630
like a lyrical model that
describes how properties change

1197
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:47,070
using some function.

1198
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:52,740
And another piece that we
incorporated was an acoustic

1199
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:58,380
model. And so vehicles can
communicate acoustically in the

1200
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:01,830
simulated environment, in order
to do these multi Vehicle

1201
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:05,130
Operations, like I mentioned
before, acoustics and

1202
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:09,870
coordination is a big piece. And
so we have that model with the

1203
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:13,920
kind of like standardized
interface that allows the

1204
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:18,480
different vehicles to send
tracking messages between each

1205
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:25,740
other, and also data. And so so
that's modeled and you know, so

1206
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:29,070
all the different obviously, the
vehicle model is very detailed.

1207
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:33,030
So the vehicle has, you know, we
talked a little bit about the

1208
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:36,210
verbal buoyancy system that we
have on board and so that pose

1209
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:39,840
some some modeling challenges
because that's unusual,

1210
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,940
especially in a simulation
environment a gazebo for

1211
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:45,690
something to change its buoyancy
in that way, and so we had to

1212
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:50,400
build some infrastructure into
ignition itself in so come up

1213
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,490
with the right plugins in order
to support that type of

1214
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:58,890
performance for the vehicles.
And, you know, it's it's pretty

1215
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:03,540
cool and works for Very well,
we're able to achieve fast in

1216
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:08,490
real time. runtimes have about
100x factor of time, which is

1217
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:13,050
great. Yes. And so even with a
few vehicles in the simulation,

1218
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:19,320
you're still at, you know, 60 to
80x. So, you know, 24 hours of

1219
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:23,670
simulation translate into 24
minutes of runtime in the

1220
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:27,180
simulator, which is great. And
it's something that, you know,

1221
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:33,150
it's it's a useful simulator,
for sure. Yeah. And so that's

1222
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:37,050
been really good. We're still
working on now, adding, you

1223
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:40,140
know, there's a whole nother
part of the vehicle sensing

1224
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:42,300
capabilities that we haven't
really touched on that has to do

1225
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:47,040
with how the vehicles navigate
underwater. And so we're now

1226
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:52,560
more focusing on those aspects.
And so we currently have the

1227
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,260
ability to simulate the type of
experience that we've described

1228
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:57,690
earlier, where vehicles, you
know, are searching around for

1229
01:20:57,690 --> 01:21:00,810
different ocean properties and
doing water samples and all that

1230
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:05,580
stuff. But now, okay, what about
navigation. That's another use

1231
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:08,550
case that, you know, could
benefit a lot from from this

1232
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:13,410
type of simulation. And so we've
worked to add bathymetry using

1233
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:17,670
levels actually. So depending on
the position of the vehicle in

1234
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:21,270
the simulation, it can load a
chunk of seafloor. And so that

1235
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:25,110
makes it pretty scalable. And
you can imagine titling huge

1236
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:29,490
regions, and have them, you
know, loaded dynamically and

1237
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:31,350
have in a memory efficient way.

1238
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:35,310
Audrow Nash: So that you'll get
what you need, or only what you

1239
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:37,680
need at the time. And that moves
over to the next tile, and you

1240
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,260
load that tile and this kind of
thing, or you load a few tiles

1241
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:44,100
around where it is, but it never
sees the edge of the tile. Okay,

1242
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:44,430
yeah,

1243
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:50,430
Ben Raanan: we ran into that. So
the tiles actually. Yeah, so So

1244
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:53,790
that's working great. And now
we're working on some, some more

1245
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:58,530
acoustic sensors that have to do
with sensing the bottom. So

1246
01:21:58,530 --> 01:22:02,430
they're what's called Doppler
velocity loggers, those are used

1247
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:06,150
for navigation, it can tell you
how fast the vehicle is flying

1248
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:09,420
over the bottom. And then it
becomes a question of odometry,

1249
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:15,240
you know, keeping track of
integrating those velocities

1250
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:19,680
into position. So you're able to
use those sensors for

1251
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,620
navigation. And so that's kind
of the next big use case that

1252
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:27,510
we're aiming the sim at, is
automated navigation, what we

1253
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:31,530
refer to. And we have Yeah, we
have some cool use cases here at

1254
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:35,430
MBARI. There's a lab that's
focused on doing terrain

1255
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:38,310
relative navigation that I think
a lot of folks have heard of, in

1256
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:42,000
the context of, you know, the
lander and Mars where they use

1257
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,280
during real time navigation to
localize understand what they

1258
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:48,390
are before they landed. And so
we do the same using the

1259
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:52,620
seafloor, using maps that were
acquired with the really big,

1260
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:55,860
much more expensive vehicles
later, you can load those in and

1261
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:58,740
use that in order to localize
yourself based on a cemetery

1262
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:04,050
where you are going to like Sam
says, and so. So that's another

1263
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:11,520
aspect. I guess one more cool
piece in that is that together

1264
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:16,770
with the simulation plugins, and
all the pieces that the folks

1265
01:23:16,770 --> 01:23:19,050
that open robotics have working
very hard and doing a tremendous

1266
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:22,770
job doing, those are all going
to be open source and the RTR.

1267
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:25,740
And so that's going to be
available for the community to

1268
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:28,560
use and leverage. And we're
hoping that folks pick pieces

1269
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:33,750
up, you know, and use them and
improve them. So pull requests

1270
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:37,560
are welcome, I guess, launch
around open source community.

1271
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:41,280
But in addition to that, we're
also going to be releasing a

1272
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:45,750
Docker image that has a version
of the vehicles flight code. So

1273
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:50,010
folks can, you know, play around
with both and operate the

1274
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:54,870
vehicles with the flight code in
the loop. And in addition to

1275
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:59,370
that, we also have an interface
to the vehicle that's a network

1276
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:04,980
based interface. And so the idea
is, for folks that can't have

1277
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,980
access, for example, to the
flight code, they're still able

1278
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:12,570
to send commands using this
interface to the vehicle and

1279
01:24:12,570 --> 01:24:16,590
derive it from their
application. And so we refer to

1280
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:20,640
that as the backseat driver. And
so the idea will be eventually

1281
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,860
that you level with those Docker
images to create your own

1282
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:26,370
application that's able to get
telemetry data from the main

1283
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:30,390
vehicle application, feed it
into your app for processing,

1284
01:24:30,390 --> 01:24:33,360
whatever your use case is, and
issue commands back to the

1285
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:37,950
vehicle to you know, pilot
within the the environment. And

1286
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,520
in theory, if everything's
right, you should be able to

1287
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:45,690
take that backseat application
that you've developed and put it

1288
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:49,830
on a Jetson or whatever that's
mounted on board L or UV inside

1289
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:54,060
the home and have it pilot
vehicle at sea. And so that's

1290
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:57,750
awesome. Yeah, so the idea is
very much for this whole package

1291
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:00,750
to kind of be something that's
deployable by single use. are so

1292
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:03,600
they can do development again
for their back seat application

1293
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:07,740
or whatever using this interface
that we've come up with. And

1294
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:11,310
later take the same application,
put it on board and have it work

1295
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:11,730
at sea.

1296
01:25:13,889 --> 01:25:17,399
Audrow Nash: That seems awesome.
I like I like that. And it

1297
01:25:17,399 --> 01:25:20,699
sounds like last, I haven't been
very involved in this at all at

1298
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:24,419
open robotics. So just hearing
about it is very cool. But it's,

1299
01:25:24,449 --> 01:25:27,119
it sounds like you guys have
done a tremendous amount of work

1300
01:25:27,239 --> 01:25:31,409
to make it so that you have a
realistic ocean environment, for

1301
01:25:31,409 --> 01:25:35,039
your simulation for your robot
in simulation to drive around

1302
01:25:35,579 --> 01:25:39,329
and interact with. Very awesome.

1303
01:25:40,110 --> 01:25:44,160
Ben Raanan: Yeah. Yeah, we I
mean, there's always room for

1304
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:50,010
improvement. And, you know, we
really focus on building, I

1305
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:53,700
wouldn't say it's the best ocean
model, right? There are

1306
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:56,910
definitely ways to do things
better. And we hope that over

1307
01:25:56,910 --> 01:26:00,930
time, things will improve. But I
think that goal was to kind of

1308
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:05,580
close the loop to get you to an
environment that is close enough

1309
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:10,260
to the real thing that allows
you to work on I'd say, kind of

1310
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:15,450
guidance level parts, right. So
not so much the control, but

1311
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:16,620
maybe a layer above.

1312
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,700
Audrow Nash: And you wanted to
do. Right, exactly,

1313
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:23,370
Ben Raanan: exactly. And debug
and work in a multi vehicle

1314
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:27,810
setting. And so, like I said,
per use case, I'm sure that will

1315
01:26:27,810 --> 01:26:32,520
continue to improve the system.
But at this point, it is it's

1316
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,250
pretty good. It's good enough to
definitely be able to test out

1317
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:38,250
some of these scenarios. And
much faster and real time

1318
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:44,160
capability is a godsend, really
nice. Yeah. So so that's really

1319
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:44,490
cool.

1320
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:49,050
Audrow Nash: What do you so
thinking forward? Where do you

1321
01:26:49,050 --> 01:26:53,160
imagine this whole project? And
kind of the work you're doing at

1322
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:55,890
MBARI? Going? So maybe like
five years, 10 years in the

1323
01:26:55,890 --> 01:27:01,020
future? Where Where do you think
it will be? What do you hope it

1324
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:01,410
will be?

1325
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:07,590
Ben Raanan: Yeah, so I guess
we're still at a point. So the

1326
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:11,610
way I think of it here is that
we've done a tremendous job,

1327
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:16,410
getting a persistent platform
that's reliable. And it's taken

1328
01:27:16,410 --> 01:27:22,050
us the project for for LRE. V
has been running since 2008. So

1329
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:25,680
even before I've just Institute,
but it's taken a while to get to

1330
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:29,190
the point where the system is
now stable, and very, very

1331
01:27:29,190 --> 01:27:38,940
reliable. And so now, I guess,
sensing and planning are the two

1332
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:43,920
big. Next, I guess challenges
that we have, okay, so

1333
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:47,040
everything we do on the system
is still pretty rudimentary. So

1334
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:50,370
we have really cool planning
algorithms that, you know, climb

1335
01:27:50,370 --> 01:27:54,210
gradients, but they use pretty
rudimentary math, there's a lot

1336
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:55,290
more that we can do to

1337
01:27:55,290 --> 01:27:58,950
Audrow Nash: improve, like, keep
getting more algae, like if you

1338
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:03,000
keep seeing more, it's good. And
if you don't, it's you've

1339
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,350
reached the center or something.

1340
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,500
Ben Raanan: Right. So
boundaries, the algorithms that

1341
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:11,580
we're using are, I guess,
there's room for improvement.

1342
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:15,000
They're great. Don't get me
wrong, we do tree work. And

1343
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,530
yeah, but yeah, but but there's
so so that's one piece where,

1344
01:28:19,530 --> 01:28:23,550
you know, the autonomy piece
where the vehicles can help plan

1345
01:28:23,610 --> 01:28:27,990
and do and do things in
conjunction together, is, I

1346
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:31,440
think, where we'll see big
advancements, I'm hoping that,

1347
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:35,280
you know, the system that we
described earlier, where we have

1348
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:39,570
kind of like a power system,
yeah, observatory is something

1349
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:43,950
that, you know, will come into
reality. And I think the same is

1350
01:28:43,950 --> 01:28:47,820
also going to be paramount, and
developing those type of

1351
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:50,940
systems. Because, like I
mentioned, there are lots of

1352
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:55,620
challenges, communication, and
other aspects that currently, we

1353
01:28:55,620 --> 01:29:01,620
just aren't sure how we're going
to solve. And, and being able to

1354
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:03,690
simulate everything, and much
faster real time, it kind of

1355
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:05,940
lends itself to iterative
methods and other other

1356
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:09,600
techniques that, you know, will
hopefully help resolve and close

1357
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,970
some of these gaps without
having to go to see every time

1358
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:16,050
and, and the overhead that goes
into that. And so I think I

1359
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:19,860
think this mobile observatory,
if we can be there in 10 years,

1360
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:24,300
I think that's going to be
pretty amazing. So cool. Yeah.

1361
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:27,750
And then I guess another piece
where I'm really hoping to see

1362
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:31,050
this project evolve into is, you
know, we've put tremendous

1363
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:34,230
effort into building an
infrastructure. That's, you

1364
01:29:34,230 --> 01:29:37,890
know, making its way into
upstream into gazebo and

1365
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:42,060
ignition at the core of it. And
so I think, you know, what I

1366
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:45,120
would really like to see is
ignition being adopted widely by

1367
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:48,450
the marine community, and other
folks coming in and using this,

1368
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:52,080
you know, at MBARI. We're sure
100% that we can make good use

1369
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:56,670
of this technology and this
application, but we're really

1370
01:29:56,670 --> 01:30:00,870
hoping that others also pick it
up and use it and contribute

1371
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:05,820
back to it and forget or
whatever it is. But use it use

1372
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:08,760
it, you know, we're also lucky
in the capacity that we have

1373
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:11,640
access to the ocean. But there
could be some brilliant minds

1374
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:15,480
out there that may not have that
type of budget or just straight

1375
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:18,750
up, you know, don't have access
to the ocean. And so we're

1376
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:22,680
hoping that that will increase
exposure, people will be able to

1377
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:26,400
develop these types of
applications, and perhaps even

1378
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,620
communicate with us and we can
get them on the vehicles to run

1379
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:32,340
et Cie. So that's also very
exciting aspect of this project

1380
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:35,730
they'd like to see evolve and
curious to see what kind of

1381
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:40,170
collaborations and partnerships
we form, with this sim kind of

1382
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:44,850
being as the is the platform
that connects, you know, because

1383
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:45,150
it's out

1384
01:30:45,150 --> 01:30:47,610
Audrow Nash: in the community.
So yeah, you get a bunch of

1385
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:51,420
people that can try it out and
start to get involved and see if

1386
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:54,480
they fit well. And if they
really would want to do this,

1387
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:55,650
that seems wonderful.

1388
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,860
Ben Raanan: Yeah, yeah,
hopefully. So and I mean, there

1389
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,170
are so you know, other
Institute's that, you know,

1390
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:05,520
already are doing this type of
work. There's very little

1391
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,250
overlap, even within MBARI,
different platforms, different

1392
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:11,250
code bases. And so there's a lot
that we could do for

1393
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:14,640
standardization, and then
bringing, you know, putting out

1394
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:18,270
different parts of the software,
or even just interfaces to make

1395
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:24,420
things, you know, a little more
interchangeable. And if I work

1396
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:27,810
very hard developing a terrain
relative navigation system, you

1397
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:30,060
know, I'm hoping that somebody
else can pick it up and use it

1398
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:33,810
as well. Totally. So that's
another piece.

1399
01:31:34,650 --> 01:31:36,960
Audrow Nash: Yeah, it seems like
this is the way things go.

1400
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,650
Typically, when it's a space,
that's more exploratory, like,

1401
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:43,950
there are very few people or few
organizations doing work, like

1402
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:46,080
you guys are doing. Therefore,
there's very little

1403
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:49,710
standardization around it. But
think, I think creating the sim

1404
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:53,430
is a wonderful thing, because
now a bunch of people can try

1405
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:56,040
it, and they can run their code
on your platforms in the

1406
01:31:56,040 --> 01:32:01,350
simulation. And then there can
start to be more buy in from the

1407
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:05,220
community around this and more
investment in ways of doing

1408
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:08,730
things which leads to
standardization. So I am

1409
01:32:08,730 --> 01:32:12,990
optimistic for the future, and
kind of seeing where this will

1410
01:32:12,990 --> 01:32:19,800
go. I think that'll be awesome.
Yeah, hopefully. Do you. So what

1411
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:24,450
advice do you have for people
that are say, say, like a

1412
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:28,740
college student or something
that would like to be involved

1413
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:32,370
in this line of work? What
advice for them Do you have?

1414
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:36,270
Ben Raanan: Well, so I was very
much in that, you know,

1415
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:39,720
position. When I first started
here, like I mentioned, I

1416
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:43,470
started as an intern here at
MBARI. And I actually don't

1417
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:46,530
have a formal engineering
background, my background is in

1418
01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:51,090
marine science. So you know, I
think you just have to want it

1419
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:56,820
and be curious. And then seek
out, be outspoken, don't wait

1420
01:32:56,820 --> 01:33:01,230
for the opportunity to come to
you. So your quick story that,

1421
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:03,180
you know, at the time, when I
did my internship, there was

1422
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:08,250
actually wasn't budget for me to
come here and be an intern. And

1423
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:12,150
I already had met with a pi. And
we had discussed a potential

1424
01:33:12,150 --> 01:33:14,940
project and was very excited for
the opportunity. But then

1425
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:20,370
suddenly, there wasn't enough
budget to host me. And so that

1426
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:22,470
was the point where I was like,
Okay, I'm gonna make this

1427
01:33:22,470 --> 01:33:25,770
happen. And I reached out and
wrote some blogs and ended up

1428
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:28,230
raising enough money to be able
to fund my own internship.

1429
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:33,150
Right, so, but I guess the the
piece is beyond the money, it's

1430
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:38,250
being proactive, and, and really
wanting to take part, I think,

1431
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:42,600
also, intellectually, we'd like
to see more people from

1432
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:46,260
different disciplines,
especially more can engineering

1433
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:51,180
based in computer science base,
and come to do ocean research.

1434
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:55,050
Because there's a lot of room
for that type of knowledge to

1435
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:58,620
make it into our community and
contribute. So if you're looking

1436
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:03,840
to be very impactful, and help
understand what the environment

1437
01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:06,120
is doing, and how we're
impacting the environment, and

1438
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:09,480
how it's changing, this is a
really good field for you to

1439
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:14,100
come in, and apply expertise or
your research or just develop

1440
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:18,600
your interests and in
contribute, and so internships

1441
01:34:18,630 --> 01:34:22,440
are a great way to start. But a
lot of the people that work in

1442
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:27,900
this community, because they're
so they believe, you know, they

1443
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:33,210
want to see progress. They're
very friendly, and they're happy

1444
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:39,150
to help. So get on our website,
poke around, send an email, you

1445
01:34:39,150 --> 01:34:43,470
know, it's it's always great to
hear from people. And if we can

1446
01:34:43,470 --> 01:34:48,930
help we, we try to. So, yeah, I
guess, being proactive and not

1447
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:53,670
being deterred. You know,
there's all kinds of reasons why

1448
01:34:53,670 --> 01:34:57,210
not to do things, but if you are
curious, just go ahead and shoot

1449
01:34:57,210 --> 01:35:01,590
or know or learn something new
and Push forward, eventually you

1450
01:35:01,590 --> 01:35:06,630
get there. I don't know. Maybe
that's a really broad piece of

1451
01:35:06,630 --> 01:35:09,210
advice. But that's what I got.
It sounds

1452
01:35:09,209 --> 01:35:15,539
Audrow Nash: wonderful. Lastly,
do you have any contact info or

1453
01:35:15,659 --> 01:35:18,329
links or anything you'd like to
make sure that we share with

1454
01:35:18,329 --> 01:35:18,989
this episode?

1455
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:23,640
Ben Raanan: Sure. So I guess,
obviously, there are simulation

1456
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:25,830
framework that we're developing,
which is already open and out

1457
01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:28,830
there. And so we'll include the
links, that's actually I know

1458
01:35:28,830 --> 01:35:36,510
SRF repo or C, these days. And
we'll go ahead and share that.

1459
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:40,890
My information can be found on
the bar website, and I'll share

1460
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:44,190
that as well. I'm also on
LinkedIn, Twitter, all those

1461
01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:48,060
great platforms. So feel free to
reach out if you're interested.

1462
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:51,240
Especially if you want to use
the sim or if you have an idea

1463
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:53,910
for a vaccine application that
you'd like to see running at C

1464
01:35:54,060 --> 01:36:00,690
mon are taught this class
longer. AGVs Let's talk. Yeah,

1465
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:05,880
that's, that's pretty much it. I
MBARI has a wonderful website

1466
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:09,060
that's full with data in
interesting stories. So feel

1467
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:12,000
free to visit there. But that's
pretty much it.

1468
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,390
Audrow Nash: Okay, awesome. It's
been wonderful talking to you.

1469
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:17,610
Ben Raanan: Thank you very much
for having me.

1470
01:36:18,990 --> 01:36:25,860
Audrow Nash: Hi, everyone. Thank
you for listening to this

1471
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:30,300
conversation with Ben Ron on.
Thank you again to our founding

1472
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:32,910
sponsor, open robotics. See you
next time.
