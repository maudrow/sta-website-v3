00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,739
Audrow Nash: This is a
conversation with Dan O'Mara,

2
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:09,239
who is a founder and the COO of
Circuit Launch and Mechlabs,

3
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:12,239
Circuit Launches a space for
hardware entrepreneurs in

4
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:16,709
Oakland, California. And Mechlabs
is a project-based course

5
00:00:16,979 --> 00:00:21,239
for robotics education. What
does a robotics education look

6
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,599
like to you? Dan jokes during
the interview that if you're at

7
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:27,899
a university that you need to
major in electrical engineering,

8
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:31,019
mechanical engineering and
computer science, to get a

9
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:34,649
robotics education, some
universities do have a dedicated

10
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,979
robotics program, but it's a big
commitment, both in terms of

11
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:41,309
time and money. And what if you
already have a degree, even an

12
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,119
engineering? Should you go back
to school? I have friends and

13
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,669
family considering this
question. And I feel like

14
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:51,209
there's a gap here, where a
group of would-be roboticists

15
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:54,359
don't know how to get started.
And this seems to be one of the

16
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,889
spots where mech lab fits well.
I also find it interesting that

17
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:02,519
Mechlabs basically does the
opposite of what universities do

18
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:07,079
on several levels, as you'll see
during this interview, and that

19
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,459
doing so has worked well for
them. They are, as Dan says,

20
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:14,699
during the interview, creating a
program that they wanted to

21
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:18,509
learn from. I'm Audrow Nash,
this is the Sense Think Act

22
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,809
Podcast. Thank you to our
founding sponsor Open Robotics.

23
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,899
And now, here's my conversation
with Dan O'Mara. Dan, would you

24
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:28,799
introduce yourself?

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,570
Dan O'Mara: Sure, I'm Dan
O'Mara, the COO of Circuit Launch

26
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,870
and Mechlabs, we are a
basically a community space for

27
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,080
robotics and hardware
engineering, with corking shared

28
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,860
labs, as well as a educational
program for mechatronics.

29
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,409
Audrow Nash: I don't want to
talk about both of those things.

30
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,919
Let's start with Circuit Launch,
would you tell me kind of the

31
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:55,499
story of Circuit Launch how it's
come to what it is?

32
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,640
Dan O'Mara: Sure, I think
Circuit Launch grew up in the

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,270
bay area here as a space coming
off the the tail end of like the

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,480
fall of tech shop, and the
understanding of like that,

35
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,450
there were all of these
entrepreneurs and people in this

36
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,050
area who are doing hardware,
electronics and robotics, and

37
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,800
like, this is the Bay Area, we
don't have space to do that,

38
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,220
where you can run a business
like this kind of in your garage

39
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,190
and a lot of other places. But
eventually, you do need some

40
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,940
type of space to build things in
a workshop and lab tools and all

41
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,910
of the that stuff. And we just
realized that there are all

42
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,570
these entrepreneurs who are
doing, you know, new companies,

43
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,990
like because of the start of
Kickstarter, and all of the

44
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,540
great robotics technologies that
are starting to become a lot

45
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,010
more available. And we need, you
know, they need space, they need

46
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,040
shirt labs, they need
facilities, they need that any

47
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,520
you know, I make a joke that you
know, we're not we work we don't

48
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,250
have you know, we don't provide
scented candles with your your

49
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,170
members. We're a little messy,
chic, we, you know, bow, you

50
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,660
know, one of the things that
really resonated on our

51
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,990
marketing language and website
is it's like, you know, do you

52
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,750
want to put a soldering iron on
your desk come work here, like

53
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,260
this is where we, you know, we
want you who are building stuff

54
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,840
making stuff. During that I
mean, we have we have one person

55
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,300
right now has a metal lathe that
he snuck onto his desk,

56
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,710
basically. And so in the
upstairs area, so like that, we

57
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:29,040
realized that there is such a
need for like a community and a

58
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,640
place where you can work and you
can share with other roboticists

59
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,360
and other electronics, hardware
specialists and, and everything

60
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,300
and build a business. And so
that's what we really focused

61
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,150
on. We said entrepreneurs who
are building hardware and

62
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,240
robotics businesses, we want to
have a space for them. And we

63
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,320
want to make this work. And so
that was the original side of

64
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,650
it. We partnered with our
building owner, which is also

65
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,470
another crucial part of our
business model, to be able to

66
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,530
provide that space and to be
able to make that so that we

67
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,810
weren't going to just grow big,
and then all of a sudden the

68
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,170
building owner, you know,
creates a lease situation where

69
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,430
we could. And it was it was a
wonderful match made in heaven.

70
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,850
We found an incredible business
building for about 32,000 square

71
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,960
feet. And we've started building
our community from just a few

72
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,100
people. And we used to let you
know any kind of company come in

73
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,680
and now we're over 95%
specifically, robotics not even

74
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,040
like, like we used to do like
oh, you know, if you're a lawyer

75
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,710
that works in the patent space,
you can come here if you're a

76
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,610
you know, you do some software,
somewhat something you could

77
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,700
come in like there, and now it's
just really our community has

78
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,380
become all about robotics, which
is great. And that's really what

79
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,310
we're, we're we're creating and
fostering and now people want to

80
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,420
build their companies from
marine robotics to you know, IoT

81
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,570
devices to Krub the we have a
company that just won the the

82
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,140
department energy E robot prize
From the robots, they're a

83
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,340
carpet cleaning robot. So it's
just all of these, these people

84
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,060
came. And, you know, we rebuilt
it. And they came. And that's

85
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,640
really the kind of the story.
And we've, we've been constantly

86
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,780
working with startups to be
like, give them what they need,

87
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,510
which is sometimes the ability
to have a desk, sometimes the

88
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,800
ability to expand into an
office. And then sometimes it's

89
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,560
the ability to go bankrupt and
have all of your employees start

90
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,310
new businesses and new companies
and go into little other places

91
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,730
and downsize things. So that
flexible space was what we

92
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,300
really knew that our community
needed. And then market tested

93
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,830
it. And now we have a really
flourishing awesome community

94
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,670
that we're leveraging to create
a, you know, an education

95
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,260
program on top of and get more
people, robotics experience and

96
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,260
projects and mentorship and
everything else.

97
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,520
Audrow Nash: It's awesome that
it's 95% occupancy.

98
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,459
Dan O'Mara: We're 100% occupied
just 95% Robotics 95% Robotics.

99
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:03,359
Where,

100
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,080
Audrow Nash: yeah, that's so
exciting. Yeah, cuz I was there

101
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:12,810
with Hello, buddy. Two, three
summers ago, as an intern for

102
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,380
them. And it was really
wonderful to be in the space.

103
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,770
Like, I loved all the robotics
that was going on around. And I

104
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,650
think I don't remember numbers,
but it was it didn't I don't

105
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,640
think we were, I don't think it
was 100% occupied two or three

106
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,800
years ago. Now. That's
wonderful. Gosh, and we just

107
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,860
went to the block party, or you
just had the block party, and it

108
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,350
was wonderful to see the turnout
for that

109
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,890
Dan O'Mara: robot, block party.
Barbecue, we do that every,

110
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,310
we're now that's our second one
in six months, their second one,

111
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,650
you know, in a year. So we've
done we're hope planning to do

112
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,550
those every six months, and it's
been now we had 40 Different

113
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,260
robotics companies and vendors
and demos all come out. And with

114
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,000
the job fair, and everything, it
was really

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,200
Audrow Nash: fun of it. Yeah. So
I mean, from my perspective, it

116
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,740
kind of seems like it's part co
working space. And then part

117
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,240
makerspace, with like laser
printers and CNC machines, and I

118
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,570
don't know all these things. And
then the focus on community.

119
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,680
Dan O'Mara: So that, like, from
our marketing side of point,

120
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,950
we're trying to, kind of, in
many ways, kill off those two

121
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,850
terms, coworker, and robot and
makerspace. And it's

122
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,040
interesting, because that,
that's really about where

123
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,730
really, so the the co working
side, obviously, we're shared

124
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,630
offices, you can read desks and
offices, that mean, it's co

125
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,290
working. Yeah, but, you know, co
working really kind of doesn't

126
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,920
explain the fact that you have
great labs and tools and 3d

127
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,320
printers and, you know, an
electronics bench and a

128
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,260
soldering bench and that you
can, you know, if you want to

129
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,320
put a 3d printer on your, your
dedicated desk, you know, you

130
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,600
can put a 3d printer on your
dedicated desk and run it all

131
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,650
night long, right? All of that.
And so that's really why we, you

132
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,040
know, co working is very much
this sense of, like, that's a

133
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,130
dead business because of we
work, right. And so we want

134
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,800
Audrow Nash: to I mean, there's
no more potential for a company

135
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,470
to start there. Because we were
kind of in applies that.

136
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,560
Dan O'Mara: Well, not even
monopolize, but just that, you

137
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,790
know, people aren't interested
in the like, coworking has a bad

138
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,120
rap because of it from an
investment profile and

139
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,760
everything else, right. And
we're so much more than that.

140
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,190
Like you, we don't want to be
pigeon holed into the idea of

141
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,470
just like, you know, you're
you're we're all working

142
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,350
together. And it's like, we have
a full lap and facilities and we

143
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,170
want to, you know, in a
community there, which is so

144
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,590
much more valuable than
Makerspace side of it. Another

145
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,820
business that is kind of doomed
to fail for most most people's

146
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,310
minds, right, especially after
Tech Shop. Right?

147
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,360
Audrow Nash: I don't know, Tech
Shop.

148
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,150
Dan O'Mara: Oh, okay. So, Tech
Shop was. And that's partly

149
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,170
because the space you're in fits
more with what we're doing. Like

150
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,670
we, we don't want to be a
makerspace we want to be an on a

151
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,020
shared Fab Lab, by intellect.
It's mainly the difference is

152
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,250
the level of entrepreneurs and
robotics companies, rather than

153
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,850
hobbyists and makers, right?
Yeah. And not to say that we

154
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,630
don't want makers and hobbyists,
we were happy to take them. But

155
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,800
we also realized that we want we
want people cutting edge

156
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,410
industry professionals in our
space and doing right. And so

157
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,760
Tech Shop was kind of the first
big Makerspace like, I mean,

158
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,660
make in magazine, they all kind
of evolved with tech shop to be

159
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,200
one of the largest, most well
known makerspaces, you know, in

160
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,480
the world, and Tech Shop, grew
on this very unsustainable

161
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,880
model. And then they made a lot
of mistakes. And obviously, we

162
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,580
don't want to go into that, but
they went bankrupt. And then all

163
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,160
of these makers and
professionals and entrepreneurs

164
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,330
who, who realized, hey, shared
laboratories and shared

165
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,500
resources is a it's a good thing
and an economically viable thing

166
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,300
for my business. And now I don't
have have that

167
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,270
Audrow Nash: anymore, right?
Totally. Yeah, so but

168
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,660
Dan O'Mara: so what we do, and
part of what tech shops issues,

169
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,750
whereas they didn't support
their entrepreneurs enough, they

170
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,350
supported their hobbies and
makers. But the problem with

171
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,010
that is that there is a limited
amount of money you can make off

172
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,590
of a hobbyist, because there are
always going to be, you know,

173
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,170
where an entrepreneur is
somebody who can be able to

174
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,310
support a community and be able
to invest in new tools, and have

175
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,790
all of those things in a
creates, and then build larger

176
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,240
office, you know, and be in
bigger offices and support a

177
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,930
space because that, you know,
having monthly memberships have

178
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,470
just a small amount and can't,
it can be hard to run an

179
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,010
industrial space with all of
these resources on whatever. So

180
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,190
having those those places for
entrepreneurs, and that's where

181
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:52,050
we realize it's like, if we
point ourselves towards the

182
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,560
helping entrepreneurs and
helping small businesses go from

183
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,100
like a small desk all the way up
to a larger office and help them

184
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,980
you know, introduce them into
networking and funding and all

185
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,100
of these things. Like I think
we're we're a little bit more

186
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,240
akin to an incubator than we are
a makerspace. Except we don't

187
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,450
take, we don't take that
percentage of equity from

188
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,390
anybody, we just want people to
pay for space and join our

189
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,490
community. And then that in
itself, has so many dividends.

190
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,510
Audrow Nash: Definitely. Very
interesting. Yeah, I've been. So

191
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,300
I've gone to a ton of
makerspaces. Because I find them

192
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,950
quite useful. I just trying to
be involved with hardware. And I

193
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,280
often see they're incredibly
underfunded, they're lacking,

194
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,520
like, kind of like, the really
knowledgeable people, like

195
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,590
they'll get burned out, because
they're helping everyone and

196
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:45,690
then they end up leaving. And
then often because of maybe the

197
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,830
weird funding situation, they're
very political often, which is

198
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,170
kind of like stepping into a
toxic environment, I just wanted

199
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,300
to use a 3d printer, this kind
of thing.

200
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,890
Dan O'Mara: Yeah, and it is
hard, we found that, you know,

201
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,020
we love our maker community,
don't get me wrong, I don't want

202
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,270
to say anything bad about the
makers, and the hobbyists who

203
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,450
come and use definitely is
wonderful. But entrepreneurs are

204
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,950
a lot more hands off. Like, I
don't have to teach the most

205
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,240
basic, like, everyone, when you
when we focus on entrepreneurs,

206
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,120
and robotics companies, everyone
is an expert in something,

207
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,600
right. And this will even come
back to when we are when we're

208
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,270
talking about education side of
things, right? Because it's very

209
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:29,970
much a pure we a pure learning
system as well. Yeah. And that

210
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,810
if everyone's coming as a an
expert in something, they've

211
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,500
learned how to learn, right. And
the same thing with a space

212
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,370
where if people are coming in,
they have a large expertise in

213
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,250
this one thing, they probably
they don't know how to do all

214
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,340
this other stuff. But the fact
that they can learn it and do

215
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,750
it, well is something that is is
very likely, and they don't you

216
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,950
don't do a lot of hand holding,
right? Where I find that with

217
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,410
some of the makerspaces
particularly tech shop, I found

218
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,650
that they they had the their
their staff were called Dream

219
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:08,370
coaches. Right. But they were
minimum wage, people who maybe

220
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,910
learned how to use the machines
a day before everyone else.

221
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,140
Right. And, and the amount of
help that ever all of the

222
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,830
members needed on all of the
machines and how to do things,

223
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,680
and all of that stuff that
wasn't part of their business

224
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,890
model that was just supplied as
your membership for free. And

225
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,670
they're understaffed. People,
right. So yeah, it becomes

226
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,690
really hard to run a space when
you are educating every single

227
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,310
person, the best makerspaces I
found are they do have ways like

228
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,820
where you say are very community
are very like, like politics

229
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,260
side, because the community has
to provide that. Yeah. Not, you

230
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,700
know, the tears and not the
makerspace variable. But you

231
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,490
have to create the community
that does that, in many ways.

232
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,940
We've, we've done that to a
large degree, because then that,

233
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,990
you know, but it's no longer how
to use the laser cutter, it's

234
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,960
how to get your batteries
certified for shipping, how to

235
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,250
get FCC certified for saying,
and that's where, you know, if

236
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,550
we had created a space that was
kind of like makerspaces for

237
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,890
that, you know, it's a lot to
leave handhold every single

238
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,850
person through, so that, you
know, I'm just continually

239
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,030
impressed by our community of
just how high level they are.

240
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,350
And then because of that, they
understand what it means to have

241
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,810
a shared facility and it doesn't
mean that we still don't get

242
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,760
messes and issues and politics
and all that

243
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,380
Audrow Nash: of course but yeah,
but

244
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,700
Dan O'Mara: you know, it's when
when a community is of a

245
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,730
community of experts and
everyone is kind of doing things

246
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,690
that and learning to level up
their businesses and their self

247
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:50,190
and then being in that community
of doing together the the the

248
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,180
ability to share that is
incredible. Right and where and

249
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,020
the best makerspaces do that
with the hobbyist level twos is

250
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,530
they get their their members to
Have other members and it's not

251
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,370
expected to be like management
teaches you everything.

252
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:13,140
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Let's see. So
that I mean, it's a very

253
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,560
interesting, I really liked the
model. How did you? How did you

254
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,630
come to this model of like so
coworking has its perks, but

255
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,320
it's kind of saturated by
Upwork. Or it's, like hard to

256
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,010
improve upon that. And then
makerspaces have their kind of

257
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,480
business model level issues. How
did you come to this idea of

258
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,140
targeting people, not not
targeting people, but like

259
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,740
focusing on entrepreneurs? As
opposed? Like, how did you come

260
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,930
on the business model that we've
just kind of described?

261
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,830
Dan O'Mara: Well, that from the
very beginning, like we all saw

262
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,730
what tech shop was doing, and
knew that we wanted something

263
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,570
more, because they didn't, they
didn't serve the entrepreneurial

264
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,710
like makerspaces don't serve
entrepreneurs very well, right?

265
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,230
Because it's like, well, it's
got everybody's gotta have some

266
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,510
time on the tool. Well,
sometimes an entrepreneur needs

267
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,590
all the time 100 tools, right?
And you have to be able to

268
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,130
provide some of that, that
ability of ways to to work that

269
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,640
out. And so we, from the very
beginning, we were like, well,

270
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,330
you know, I'm involved in
hardware, one of our founders

271
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,210
were involved in hardware, and
like, this is, this is what we

272
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,330
do and what we need. And so we
were like, well, there are other

273
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,690
people who are there, this is
what a good space like, this

274
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,150
would be great, because we were
like, also, let's use the

275
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,180
resource of from the building
owner having the space. And so

276
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,480
we built this all out from the
carpets to the drop ceiling and

277
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,350
everything, and saying, like,
you need to have space, and you

278
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,770
need to be able to have that
customer group and find that

279
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,530
niche. And that's where we
really, we saw that this niche

280
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:52,080
was underserved. And, you know,
we took a big bet that this

281
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,990
would be that there would be
enough people here. And now you

282
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,730
know, it's like we have a
waiting list for most of our

283
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,520
wonderful tables. And we're
happy to hear that. It's

284
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,280
wonderful for for that and we
want to expand and we're you

285
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,400
know, we are currently looking
for for more funding for our

286
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,400
round as well. And we're looking
to put more Circuit Launchers

287
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,660
out there. And specifically, the
the tie in to education was is

288
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,120
that after we built this
community, people were like,

289
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,260
Well, how did everyone here
learn how to do robotics? Yeah,

290
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:25,980
right. I want to do this, how do
I do this? And we're like, go to

291
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,730
school.

292
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:29,309
Audrow Nash: Maybe? Yeah.

293
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:30,959
Dan O'Mara: And they're like,
well, but but that they're not

294
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:33,899
teaching robotics. They're just
there, you know, I what degree

295
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:36,329
do I get? I think well, you
should go get an A, you should

296
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:39,629
go get a computer science degree
in mechanical engineering degree

297
00:17:39,629 --> 00:17:43,529
and an electrical engineering
degree. And all of

298
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,270
Audrow Nash: us learned
business, if you want to do a

299
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,690
stolen,

300
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,770
Dan O'Mara: you should learn
business, too. Yeah. And like,

301
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,830
maybe there's not enough time in
the world to be able to learn

302
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,670
all those things. So we we said,
we were like, Okay, we need a

303
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:00,930
mechatronics education program,
that immediately gets people

304
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,020
using the latest technology. And
the latest things in building

305
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,430
robots is the first step.

306
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:08,759
Audrow Nash: And from a very
pragmatic perspective to like,

307
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:11,429
this is one of the things about
having entrepreneurs and it like

308
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:15,299
they probably won't be wasting
your time, because they are,

309
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:18,779
they have skin in the game, and
their money is slowly depleting.

310
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:22,259
And this kind of thing, while
they're trying to get interest

311
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:25,559
and grow. Like Time is of the
essence for them. So they're

312
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,739
gonna do whatever is most
pragmatic for them. Well, that

313
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:29,579
that was actually

314
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:32,429
Dan O'Mara: the model that like,
led us to this type of learning,

315
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:36,629
right? But entrepreneurs are not
necessarily our target market

316
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:39,869
are the learning curves, for the
learning side of it was because

317
00:18:39,989 --> 00:18:43,889
most of most entrepreneurs are
too. Like, there's a couple

318
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:48,029
things. They're too busy to do
the thing like they can only

319
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:51,509
focus on the thing that they
need the next step. Yeah, so

320
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:53,999
unless there's some type of
immediate coaching or whatever

321
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,659
that they need, then the
business model really is if you

322
00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:00,539
need that type of doesn't like
good design services and

323
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,749
prototyping services, get them
connected with other people in

324
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:06,749
the network, right. But there's
a whole group, if you want to

325
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:09,419
work in robotics, and you don't
have a job and you're not

326
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,659
willing to like, be the
entrepreneur, like I want to

327
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:16,349
work for a company or I want to
build a robot, you know, or I

328
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:19,739
want to learn to get better in
my job, or upskill or do those

329
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:22,139
things. There's all of those
people, and that's kind of our

330
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:25,709
market for Mechlabs, which is
it's our education program.

331
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:29,249
Audrow Nash: Mechlabs. Yeah, it
sounds like so when you focus on

332
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:32,909
the entrepreneurs from the
perspective of Circuit Launch,

333
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:36,209
it seems like it's a it's a bit
of an exclusive community where

334
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:39,269
you come in and you're an
entrepreneur, and you are highly

335
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:41,429
skilled in at least one thing,
and you're good at learning and

336
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:44,699
you're pragmatic, and you can
pay the bills to occupy desk

337
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:47,189
space. And so that's a good
business model for circuit

338
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:51,959
launch, but being kind of
exclusionary. Now, it's like how

339
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:54,839
do we get the other people in a
position where they might go

340
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:59,039
into this and that's the
education program. You got it.

341
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:00,899
Gotcha. I really like that,

342
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,490
Dan O'Mara: that and then the
benefit is is that we are filled

343
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:10,110
in a community of mentors. All
of those entrepreneurs are, you

344
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,300
know, they're in the community,
they've done it they are,

345
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,330
they're on the bleeding edge of
technology and doing cool stuff,

346
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,650
right? So it's very easy to find
someone who has a lot of skill

347
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:24,090
and expertise to come in and
help people and become mentors

348
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,270
in a lot of the stuff and to be
able to get answers from too for

349
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,780
sure, if I have this very hard
problem. Now we've created this

350
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,960
community that that serves
everyone, and they've been

351
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,650
serving each other, and a lot.
And now it's being able to also

352
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,500
serve the, you know, the
students that want to come in

353
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,570
and be able to learn how to do
this as

354
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:46,079
Audrow Nash: well. Yeah. How do
you incentivize entrepreneurs to

355
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,049
be mentors? For this, because
you were saying they're very

356
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:53,789
busy. And I just imagine that's
a challenge. Or maybe you pay

357
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:58,199
them or maybe it's part of the
like, you get your desk at half

358
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,419
off, or something like this, if
you're a mentor, there's

359
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,280
Dan O'Mara: obviously incentives
to self to mentor. I think that

360
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:09,060
in general, you know, so yes, we
do pay our mentors that come in,

361
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,700
but we have a very different
model, like we're not looking

362
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,870
for instructors. That's the big
difference with our education

363
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,290
program. And Mechlabs is a
built to learn it program,

364
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,710
Audrow Nash: it is difficult to
you. Sure,

365
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,140
Dan O'Mara: so the Mechlabs is
the building to learn it

366
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,480
program. The idea is, is that
you come in and you build a

367
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,830
project, if you want to learn
ROS, you either pick a project

368
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,340
that has ROS in it, or you join
a team project that has ROS in

369
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,990
it, right. And then you build
it. And then as you go along,

370
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,050
you're you are either
individually or in a team

371
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,630
responsible for figuring out how
to implement ROS. And so

372
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:54,180
there's the side of that is that
then what happens when you get

373
00:21:54,180 --> 00:22:00,000
stuck, right? That's why you
join a program, traditionally,

374
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,640
people just say, well, we're
just going to teach you

375
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,210
everything you could possibly
need to know in an A to Z way.

376
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,890
And we're going to start at A
and it doesn't matter if you're

377
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:15,330
on B or C and you need it, you
need D and other people need to

378
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,820
have like it doesn't matter,
you're just all going to sit

379
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,520
around and wait till you found
the information get taught to

380
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:26,190
you. And or in a book in this
process, right. And that's what

381
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:30,090
an instructor does, right? They
have a curriculum. So we say no

382
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:35,520
lectures, no textbooks, no
curriculum, we say, what will

383
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,430
happen is the way you're going
to learn this, you're on D,

384
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,100
someone else's on F. And then
this is where it remember when I

385
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,930
made the tie that everyone is an
expert in something, people all

386
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,650
people are that way, we are all
human beings, we are all experts

387
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,890
in something, we've all done
something cool and can share

388
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,250
that. So that's when you get the
peer learning. So then people

389
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,700
come into our program that when
they get stuck, they then have

390
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,720
an entire team of people who all
have a ton of expertise in a lot

391
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,480
of things that are in the
program and can share their

392
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,430
expertise. And, and we have, you
know, for people who are like

393
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,850
for really deep problems, this
is where we can go to like our

394
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,030
community of like, of experts
that are working on really

395
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,950
cutting edge technology and much
more deeper technical stuff that

396
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,460
is there. And then we ask them,
then when they mentor, we're not

397
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,980
asking them to build a
curriculum. No, they don't need

398
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,940
a PowerPoint presentation. They
don't need they just come and

399
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,450
help. Yep, right? Come for a few
hours look where to go and be

400
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,720
like, Oh, this is the wrong
thing. Exactly. And so they meet

401
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,110
zero preparation, their effort
and their time commitment

402
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:48,660
becomes a lot more useful.
Right? And the and then of

403
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,630
course, mentors are what they
really like when you're

404
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,740
mentoring, especially in Silicon
Valley. That word means like

405
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,350
giving back because of all the
all the mentors and all the

406
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,700
platoons. Yeah, right. It's not
to say we don't pay our mentors

407
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,720
for that. But it is a you know,
it's it's expected that this is

408
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,230
a community we're all giving
back. And then the best part is,

409
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,610
you get to work with really
bright, upcoming roboticists

410
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,710
that you can hire for.

411
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,860
Right? And that's a really cool
thing when you can say, Oh, wow,

412
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,800
this guy is, you know, he's a
Python genius, but he's never

413
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,270
done an embedded software.
Right. I bet I could help him a

414
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,300
little bit along and then jump
in, and he could help my car.

415
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,200
Right? Yeah. Right. So that's
where this that when you're all

416
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,900
thinking about the ecosystem is
what we're building. We're

417
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,930
building an ecosystem of
entrepreneurs, and the way to

418
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:47,190
become entrepreneurs, the way to
become employees of companies

419
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,780
that are good and and to
accelerate your career and close

420
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,190
that loop. Because what we've
seen, you know, one of our

421
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,650
companies that are here is
Silicon Valley robotics. They're

422
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:03,150
an industry organization and BP
probably know, the Andhra and

423
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:06,180
all of that. And they, they're
amazing. And they've been

424
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,420
talking to a lot of the all of
the companies that are in

425
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,840
robotics, which unfortunately,
all kind of are very siloed when

426
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,780
they're not in a community. So
it can be very hard to know what

427
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,630
they need. And it can be hard
for them to say, Well, what they

428
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,500
need for from employees. Right?
Yeah. And what what they're

429
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,950
finding is, is that most of
their, their applicants are

430
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,060
mechanical engineers, right? But
what they really need is some as

431
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,210
more and they keep hiring,
computer science degrees, their

432
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:37,080
computer, they're, they're doing
hiring programmers who have

433
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:41,400
somewhere along the way, figured
out hardware, right. And so

434
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,070
there's, there's a real
disconnect of what you can learn

435
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:48,840
in school, and how you can
prepare for a job in robotics

436
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,400
and actually get the experience
and the portfolio and the hands

437
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,440
on of all of that. I mean,
that's, that's been a real

438
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:02,100
change. And what we've seen in,
in people looking in robotics,

439
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,510
to accelerate their skills and
to get jobs and to be able to

440
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:09,300
learn these things is that
there's a disconnect from what

441
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:13,230
industry needs and what
traditional education is

442
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:18,180
teaching. And we want to bridge
that gap. We want people leaving

443
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:23,370
our programs being like, Hey, I
built the the, you know, I

444
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:29,040
integrated the robotics SDK for
these servos into a ROS node.

445
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:34,170
And now this whole robot is made
with ROS Yeah. And that's my

446
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,230
portfolio and so you apply to a
job that's like, you know, needs

447
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:40,050
ROS experience, right?
Everybody says, I need ROS

448
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:43,530
experience that's on every
little thing. But how do you get

449
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:48,330
ROS experience what is out
there building a robot, and not

450
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,900
just a, you know, a turtle bot,
right? We need you need to, to

451
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,200
get deeper into some of this
ROS language and, and on

452
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,960
different things to be able to
really be useful on that. And so

453
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,840
that's where there's really,
like, there are some great

454
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,080
programs out there, but the
hands on component is what's

455
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,590
missing. And so we want people
leaving with literally the like,

456
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,070
this is what I built. Here's a
tutorial that I wrote, here's my

457
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:16,050
GitHub that shows what the code
that I did. And there's me

458
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,920
instead of just a resume that
says, I know some ROS right,

459
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,070
and then no one knows what that
is. And that that provides

460
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:28,170
people who are looking for jobs,
killer way to get into the the

461
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:28,740
industry.

462
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,370
Audrow Nash: Definitely. Yeah, I
can think so I've done some

463
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,490
hiring while at open robotics.
And it is funny, because it's

464
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,280
like the first thing that I go
to, it's not like I couldn't

465
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,090
care less about the resume. And
this is just my approach to it.

466
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,960
But go right to the GitHub, and
then look at kind of what

467
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,170
they've done and try to sauce
out what their commits are, and

468
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,140
how much of it was just like,
like, what they understand from

469
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,200
how they're doing it. And that's
really nice to be training

470
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,580
people in very pragmatic ways on
an actual project. I really

471
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,360
liked that approach.

472
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,810
Dan O'Mara: And then they get to
learn, like, well, how to use

473
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:08,040
GitHub for for hardware. That's,
that's not an easy thing, right

474
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,210
there. And, and how are all of
those things? And then we, you

475
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:15,450
know, we asked people to like
one of the minimum requirements

476
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,960
every single week, everyone has
to write it tutorial. And so

477
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,080
they start learning, good
communication skills and

478
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,010
demonstration, documentation
skills, and all of that, that we

479
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,660
want to help them demonstrate.

480
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,320
Audrow Nash: Yeah. Let's see.
That's really interesting. One

481
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,710
thing so this robot behind you,
I'd like to introduce that

482
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:40,020
robot. It was one Belcher in a
project by some students that

483
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,040
went through this correct.

484
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:45,660
Dan O'Mara: Yep. So this is
Ricci. It's based on an open

485
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:51,090
source robot robotics platform
that was developed by Paul and

486
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,870
robotics. They, they actually
sell the robot that but they've

487
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:58,890
completely open sourced the
designs. So we were the first

488
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,330
group outside of the developers
to actually build a fully

489
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:07,680
working robot, or off of
reaching, right. So we

490
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,840
originally, so the, there's a
lot of, it's kind of grown as

491
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,170
we've gone, but we started with
the torso and the head, and one

492
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:20,400
arm, and in 12 weeks, we went
from not knowing anything about

493
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,950
this robot to fully functional
working robot, which was

494
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,950
amazing, like, and these are
students this is not like, you

495
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,160
know, some of them had very
little robotics experience, and

496
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,210
some of them had a little bit
more so in 12 weeks to build

497
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,870
something that was incredible.
Our second session with with

498
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:44,160
Ricci, everyone wanted to work
on the software side is the

499
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:49,080
platform. I had, of course I
bought all the motors for the

500
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,800
extra arm, and everybody wasn't
interested in doing the arm that

501
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,910
okay, which is fine. That's our
program. If you don't like you

502
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,550
get to work on the things that
you want to work on. It's a

503
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:02,340
match Not the things you it's
not a, it's not like that

504
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,280
horrible group project you got
in school where you're like,

505
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,070
Okay, this is the thing you got
to do. There's one person who's

506
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:11,040
good at it, let's just make him
do it. Right. Yeah, like, that's

507
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,190
not what our program is ours
very much like, you might be a

508
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,330
Python, you know, a whiz. But
you want to work on motor

509
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,660
control systems in the power,
you know, in power delivery and

510
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,690
3d printing and CAD, well,
that's great. You provide your,

511
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,360
your expertise to the rest of
the students wanting to learn

512
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,780
Python. And then the other
people who have a lot more

513
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,540
experienced the MES that are
just graduated, they have a lot

514
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,120
more experience in some of the,
you know, the CAD and all of

515
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,920
that. So that's how, how that
gets trained. But so our second

516
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,400
session, I built the arm because
nobody wanted to do it.

517
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:51,239
And so, but everybody else they
did, they created, they put it

518
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:53,969
on ROS, they it was on this
thing called loops, which was

519
00:30:53,969 --> 00:30:59,219
kind of a semi open source, not
like it was an odd thing. Never

520
00:30:59,219 --> 00:31:02,129
heard of the pollen head choice.
Yeah, it's it's a, like a

521
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:05,189
distributed microcontroller
system that, you know, has a lot

522
00:31:05,189 --> 00:31:09,539
of potential, but because no one
in the world could get the

523
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:14,249
microcontrollers. But, Paul, and
we were like, well, let's, you

524
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:17,999
know, let's put this on ROS.
And like, use the Dynamixel

525
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,269
control system. Like, that's
great. That seems like to be a

526
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:24,419
good thing. And so we put them
over that, put them on a mobile

527
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:27,389
base, and then he became a
concierge robot. And he actually

528
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:30,449
walked around told jokes and
gave tours and told told people

529
00:31:30,449 --> 00:31:33,029
in the pandemic, if they weren't
wearing masks, that they want to

530
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:36,269
put a mask on. Oh, funny. So
that was the second the third

531
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:41,069
session we did again, Ricci as
the platform became a very deep

532
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:44,969
object orientation and grasping
techniques like work, so they

533
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:49,439
they rewrote a lot of the
control systems for for the the

534
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:54,599
motors, integrated all through
ROS worked with April tags, and

535
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:59,579
you know, criminal, you know,
creating a computer vision and

536
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:02,849
learning how to be able to grab
a block and we set it up so

537
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:05,399
that, you know, if you picked up
the block, the robot grabbed it

538
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:08,879
and put it back where it was
cool. And so that's kind of

539
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:12,539
their their session is that was
a smaller session of, of team.

540
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:15,299
Yeah, there's a lot of became an
amazing platform. That's

541
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:19,259
awesome. I like and it's all
open source, we publish all of

542
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:21,869
our stuff, and all of the thing
and so people who are interested

543
00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:25,769
in doing it, and that's a really
important component that we

544
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:29,909
found out for our program was
the open source part, the open

545
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:34,379
source part. So we first
started, as you know, we're

546
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:36,719
growing and building this as we
go and figuring out what we

547
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:42,299
wanted our very first pilot was
to bill to take a already

548
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,839
existing coffee robot that was
working, it's a little bit

549
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:49,199
you've seen our coffee robot,
definitely. But it's basically

550
00:32:49,229 --> 00:32:53,489
the three axis palletizing, two
arms that grab cups and things

551
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:56,669
and then put it up to a big
super automatic espresso machine

552
00:32:56,669 --> 00:32:59,789
and then delivers the cup,
right. And it's all done on

553
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:03,959
ROS. But it was done developed
by a couple of Crazy Russian

554
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:08,249
developers that are awesome.
They were there interesting. It

555
00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:12,149
but it it needed a lot of work
for for design. And so the

556
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:17,189
person who owned it wanted us to
upgrade it, and they're there.

557
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:21,659
And we found that trying to get
students to one manage client

558
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:26,999
expectations, too much being in
a little like an understanding

559
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:29,429
what they really needed and all
of that and ended up becoming

560
00:33:29,459 --> 00:33:32,999
really too. And then reverse
engineering something is often

561
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:35,579
much harder than just building
it the first time. Oh, I'm sure

562
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:38,699
right. And so that's something
that I think we've all learned

563
00:33:38,699 --> 00:33:41,999
as you go along. But in the
beginning, it can be very, like

564
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:44,069
enticing to be like, Well, I
have this thing, I can just

565
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:47,309
improve it right? Sometimes it's
really just better to kind of

566
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,950
Audrow Nash: go back to the
start over. Yes, yeah.

567
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:53,789
Dan O'Mara: And so that was our
very first session, we found

568
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:56,939
that having an and having a
closed, like we couldn't publish

569
00:33:56,939 --> 00:34:00,719
any of our work. And so ever
since then we were like No, no

570
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:04,079
open source right away. Like all
of our projects, all of the

571
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,429
things need to be like
publishable because then you can

572
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:11,669
manage, like you benefit from a
community of people most of the

573
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:14,819
time that are working on the
open source group. You know,

574
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:20,069
documentation is always hit or
miss with all projects, but

575
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:24,239
particularly open source at
least, at least they have more

576
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:26,609
information out there than
something that's totally was

577
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:30,299
right. Yeah. And so you're gonna
look at the code doing as much

578
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:32,519
reverse engineering, you can
look at the code, you can

579
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:37,229
download examples, you can work
on that. And then you you have a

580
00:34:37,229 --> 00:34:39,689
place to be able to say like,
you know, that something, at

581
00:34:39,689 --> 00:34:41,699
least somebody has done
something, it's worked,

582
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,650
Audrow Nash: right. And you can
get an idea of the community

583
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,830
around it, too. So you can see
if it's supported or not, or

584
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,210
like will other people who did

585
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:51,210
Dan O'Mara: this with no
community, like Yeah, he had

586
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,900
zero community at first. And so
now we get tons of requests all

587
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,390
the time, be like, Hey, how did
you do this? Or here's, you

588
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:00,420
know, we want to make this too.
And so we can then cut Pretty to

589
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,630
the community. And then the
benefit for that is, is then all

590
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,290
of the students learn to, you
know, to better documentation

591
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,900
and how to better, you know,
support an open source and how

592
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,650
to work in a community of people
and how to do project management

593
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:16,740
and all of the soft skills and
kind of important things that

594
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,420
you need to know, for running
and being a roboticist company,

595
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:26,160
right? Sure, all of that is
available in the, you know, the

596
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,120
in between building

597
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,750
Audrow Nash: stuff. And also, I
mean, it's all like, the skills

598
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,930
are also just very valuable, in
general, if you want to do

599
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:37,620
anything. So teaching them how
to do that, like, I mean, I use

600
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,460
Git every day. And so like
learning how to work with people

601
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,890
on that, and get feedback and
implement the feedback and this

602
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,370
kind of thing, very valuable. So
that's so cool, that you're

603
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:55,350
exposing them to all of that.
Let's see. So you mentioned that

604
00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:00,750
they do tutorials for this, or
actually, before that, how do

605
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:05,460
you how do you scope a project?
Like how do you decide Ricci

606
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:10,380
making it so Ricci grab looks at
a fiducial marker, grabs a block

607
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,350
moves it somewhere? Like how do
you pick a scope? How do you

608
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:17,280
make it not too hard? Or not too
easy? Given the students that

609
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,940
you're working with?

610
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,930
Dan O'Mara: Yeah, I mean, that's
kind of been the interesting

611
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:30,210
thing was, when we had a really,
like, scoped out project, we

612
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:34,890
found that we often had more
trouble with that and reaching

613
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,830
those goals and figuring out
what what could be happening,

614
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:42,060
what couldn't happen, then we do
in our current system. So

615
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:48,660
currently, what we try to do an
overarching project idea whether

616
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,030
you know, some of the things on
the blocks right now is like,

617
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:56,370
we'd like to do one of the
millions or, or improve on the

618
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:59,730
millions of open source Quadra
pets out there, we'd like to,

619
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,490
that's one of our ideas, we'd
like to do some more. You know,

620
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:12,030
like, autonomous driving, cars
and tracks, and like the RC car

621
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,130
kind of thing, like, those are
some of the ones we like to do.

622
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,720
We'd like to, we have a Boston
Dynamics spot, we'd like to put

623
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,170
him on ROS. That's another one.
But so there's a perfect example

624
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,650
of, you know, we'd like to do
the ROS but we'd actually like

625
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,070
to, you know, we need to choose
a project that one will appeal

626
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,650
to a bunch of people who are,
are there. So you have like, we

627
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,140
have to make it fun and
interesting and exciting, right?

628
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:40,350
So it's like if if our courses
are, you know, learn inverse

629
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:43,380
kinematics, we will get a small
percentage of people, right.

630
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:48,810
However, if we can be like, you
know, build your own juggling

631
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:55,590
robot, right. Yeah. But you
know, sometimes, you know, you

632
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,230
put that out there today. And
then as you so let's take that,

633
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,990
as example. Like, we're gonna do
a juggling robot, right. Okay.

634
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,710
So we have to one make sure that
we have the budget know what,

635
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,620
you know, what kind of actuators
we're going to need, what kind

636
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,240
of things to be able to even
capable do that. And then we put

637
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,270
like, maybe that's where we
start, right? And say, Okay,

638
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,050
we're going to build a juggling
robot. And then like, all robots

639
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,360
and all companies and everything
that you do, you have to say,

640
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,020
Okay, well, we're going to have
to learn a ton along the way.

641
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,650
And then we're going to change
the scope as where we go based

642
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:33,630
on what we have and where we
need to be. So maybe that robot

643
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:38,310
in the end is only throwing the
ball up and catching it, right.

644
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,360
And then, you know, maybe we get
two hands to do that or there,

645
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,860
but it's the beginnings of like,
it's juggling, you know, we're,

646
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,820
maybe the next session picks it
up where we left off. Yeah,

647
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:54,180
right. And then says, Okay, now
we want to balls, and then we

648
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,150
need to be able to have a vision
system for tracking. And we need

649
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,240
to be able to do that. And then
you implement that. So the the

650
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,180
project becomes, you know, make
a juggling robot several

651
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,050
sessions, and you make broad
progress on that. And then part

652
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:12,360
of it is, is to like, we don't,
you know, unlike a business

653
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,990
where you say, Okay, I'm gonna
go hire the most capable people

654
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:19,440
I can find to do these very
particular jobs. We have the

655
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,700
opposite problem. We want the
most capable people in different

656
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:28,380
things, not doing what they're
good at. Yeah. Because unless

657
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,930
they want to do that, like if
people really, they're like,

658
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,790
they're really good at this, and
they just want to get better at

659
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:37,290
it. Great that we have you too
perfect. Yeah, but, and we get a

660
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:40,350
bunch of that. But in general,
like we want, if you're really

661
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,260
good at something, you know,
diversity, probably needing to

662
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,020
know some other things and
wanting to learn those things.

663
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,140
So let's get you focused on
that. You can help the other

664
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,490
people who are not as good at
these things with their Python,

665
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,460
if you're a Python coder, or you
know if you're a mechanical

666
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,690
engineer, they're your cat.
Like, there's such traits Yeah.

667
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:05,520
And so the scope really happens
based on like, who needs who

668
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,600
needs to do what. And if we lock
ourselves to the like, while we

669
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,880
must get this end product done,
right, then it isn't as

670
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,240
efficient for for everybody,
like, we want to hit our goals,

671
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:22,380
but we're not afraid of also
changing where that scope is to

672
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,650
say, you know, so that it is
achievable. And that you can

673
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,290
then learn the things you learn,
which is way more important than

674
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:32,070
getting the end result. Yeah,
but and so we do sometimes re

675
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,450
scope a project.

676
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,470
Audrow Nash: Like that is a
great example. Yeah, yeah,

677
00:40:37,499 --> 00:40:39,989
Dan O'Mara: juggling robot
would, you know, maybe it's not

678
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:44,279
a three ball juggling robot
that's doing this. But you know,

679
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:48,059
we've developed, you know, one
ball and develop the beginnings

680
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:51,239
of a vision system that can
track those balls and catch it

681
00:40:51,269 --> 00:40:53,849
on another side, and then the
next and then it gets bigger and

682
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:57,239
better. As you go along. It's,
it's more interesting that way,

683
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:57,569
too.

684
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,720
Audrow Nash: Definitely. And
also really nice for people

685
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,140
learning. And also seeing what's
possible in this kind of thing.

686
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,420
Like, you say, juggling robot,
and it's like, oh, that sounds

687
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,760
incredibly difficult. But it's
like throwing a ball up and

688
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,810
down. Just one still difficult,
but not like incredibly

689
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,420
infeasible. And then like, maybe
you go from one arm to the

690
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,790
other, and this kind of thing,
maybe it's

691
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:22,020
Dan O'Mara: like air actuated
tubes that are on a Trump rail

692
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,920
system, right? Some way. Like,
you can scope that in different

693
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,040
ways, you know, trying to get
Ricci to do juggling would be

694
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,420
servos are just not, they're not
going to that. Yeah, and so you

695
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:38,490
do have to, and part of that, I
think is where the scoping of

696
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,760
things is actually a really
interesting problem. Because you

697
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,750
don't, you don't know how to get
to the end of the thing you want

698
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,690
to try to say this is the thing
I want to go do this is you

699
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:52,080
know, what I might need along
the way, that's the one thing

700
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:56,760
that you can't do on your own
easily, right. That's why you

701
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,240
need to join over with mentors,
because a mentor will say, hey,

702
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:04,050
you know, don't waste your time
using these servos for juggling

703
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,330
robot, and then you've just
wasted six months of your life

704
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:10,350
trying to get this robot to
juggle. Yeah. And so that's why,

705
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:13,470
you know, our programs are like,
you know, we have mentors, and

706
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:17,160
we have advisors to say, Hey,
this is feasible. This is, you

707
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,370
know, why don't we start here?
Why don't we scope this in this

708
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:23,490
way? You know, because people
come to us for our

709
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:26,790
individualized program, saying,
hey, I want to make you know, we

710
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:30,420
had another person come in and
be like, I want a trash

711
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,140
collecting robot, you know, is
what I'd like to make. It's

712
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,290
like, I'd like it to be a robot
on wheels with an arm that picks

713
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:40,260
up trash, and puts in there, and
this is their first project that

714
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:45,630
they had never done robotics
before. Yeah. Right. And to have

715
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:50,430
an expert to like say, Well,
okay, you need a full base that

716
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:56,910
can put around at least 25
pounds, right of like weight

717
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,910
plus the weight of its own
robot. And then if you're going

718
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,640
to build some type of an
extension arm system, you have

719
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,240
to be it has to be able to deal
with the mechanical torsion and

720
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,030
the the reach and the
counterbalance. And then you

721
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:11,880
have to be able to carry all of
that, like, that is not a it's

722
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,930
not a first Prime first robot.
Yeah, for sure. And so you say,

723
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:19,260
Okay, well, that what could we
start off first? Maybe we could

724
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,280
put a trash can on a mobile
base, and put a speaker and ask

725
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,120
people to help

726
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,660
Audrow Nash: like that. Yeah,
right. But there's a trash can

727
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,280
Dan O'Mara: robot that's like,
can you put a little mobile

728
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,520
base, and then we can buy really
cheap cheap powders and cheap

729
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,830
things and, and that little
speaker, and then it'd be like,

730
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,580
Hey, can you help me pick this
up? You've just created, right,

731
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:42,660
it's like, so being creative
with that scoping also allows

732
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,960
people to choose the project
that is right for them. And

733
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,540
that's the first thing you do if
you're not joining a team

734
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,540
program with the project is kind
of already scoped out. Our

735
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,210
individualized program is you
come and you talk to our

736
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:57,780
advisor, and then we help choose
a project for you that will

737
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:01,290
achieve your learning goals.
Yep. So if you're Where do you

738
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,090
want to learn? ROS? Do you
wanna learn motor control? Do

739
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:05,430
you want to learn? You know,
what are the parts of the

740
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:08,760
robotics you want to learn
first? Right, yeah. And then we

741
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,420
kind of scope that project for
where people are at and to their

742
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,080
budgets to, you know, it's like,
it's like, yes, I want to build

743
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,040
an autonomous car, like, Okay,
can you do you have a car?

744
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:25,050
That's our sensors? And like, do
we need to buy that? Yeah. So I

745
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,050
mean, all of those things come
into account. It's why robotics

746
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:31,680
is so challenging, but in the
community of program where we

747
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,980
can support those components,
and they expenses, like on a

748
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,210
team project where you know,
reaches was $6,000 worth of

749
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,420
parts, right? Yeah. So, you
know, then that becomes

750
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,820
amortized, and everyone to work
on and make something really

751
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,180
cool.

752
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:51,750
Audrow Nash: So one thing that
strikes me with this, it seems

753
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,500
like so it seems absolutely
wonderful, like what are what an

754
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,650
absolutely great way for people
to learn. I'm wondering, I'm

755
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:01,380
thinking about how it would
scale ill, because one thing

756
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,990
that it strikes me about, or it
strikes me about it is that you

757
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:14,100
really need a knowledgeable,
engaged instructor or mentor, I

758
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,890
suppose, like someone to
facilitate this whole process.

759
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:19,020
What do you call them? Because
they're not they're not exactly

760
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,040
maybe their mentor.

761
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,760
Dan O'Mara: So, you know,
advisor is an easy advisor do

762
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,010
that. But we actually created as
we create a system so that the

763
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,230
mentors and advisors can help
run this help run the sessions.

764
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:37,140
Yeah, right. And those sessions
are lead. They're very

765
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,230
structured in like the what what
you do, you know, you have, like

766
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,770
our team session, we have a
project management, like, you

767
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:46,320
know, Monday, we do our project
management, we talked about all

768
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,930
the things that were done, we
follow kind of a scrum

769
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:52,830
platforms, we've divided we
choose our sprint, we get all of

770
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:55,980
the things together. And someone
kind of runs that. And we've

771
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,880
played around with actually
different people running that

772
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,840
each time. Oh, I like that,
which is also really helpful.

773
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,760
And some things or students
Yeah. Oh, so the students often

774
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,150
run the sessions, right. And
then we have collaborative work

775
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:15,420
sessions where everybody's
working together. And then we

776
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,710
have like a show and tell day,
where people are actually, they

777
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,310
show what their work is, they
get feedback from in person, all

778
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:27,510
of that kind of stuff. And, you
know, what's often what's

779
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:31,860
amazing is is though that, like
it's with mentorship, everyone

780
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,520
thinks like, Oh, I gotta have
that really, really highly. It

781
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,670
is accessible person or
intelligent person to run all of

782
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:43,680
those meetings, and all of that
stuff. And the structure helps

783
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,710
with a lot of that. And then
peers, because a lot of the

784
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:50,070
expertise comes from mostly from
their peers, because again,

785
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:54,720
everyone's an expert in
something. And the mentors spend

786
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,680
less time. And they also don't
teach like mentors don't

787
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,280
lecture. There's no one anyone
lecture. So we train our mentors

788
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,360
to simply say, to help them find
the thing that they need the

789
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,290
next step, right? Because in a
world where you can learn

790
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:14,700
anything on the internet
streaming thing, it's not, you

791
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,430
know, where will you get the
information from? I must have

792
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:21,480
the person in the information in
their head, it's how you find

793
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,570
that information becomes the
real challenge, right? Yeah. And

794
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:29,100
mentors become less than the
purveyors of information and

795
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:33,990
more the guidance along your own
path for you finding the

796
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:39,270
information. Yes, like, you
know, I think of my exploration

797
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:44,370
of, you know, I've been building
an espresso machine on my

798
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:48,690
bicycle. I'm in middle, like,
I'm in the middle robotics area,

799
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:51,330
like I'm an advisor and the
technical mentors, but I'm also

800
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:54,330
loved, I have a passion about
it, as well. And I'm not an

801
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:58,830
expert in any one thing, right?
So I was learning some basic,

802
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:02,490
like, learning to do certain
basic electronics, really, I've

803
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:05,010
done a cabinet on maker stuff,
but I've never really done basic

804
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:08,880
electronics stuff. And so I was
learning, the the beginnings of

805
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,610
putting a whole bunch of sensors
in my espresso machine, because

806
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:16,620
I'm also a coffee nerd. And I
was working on learning how to

807
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:21,540
build a PCB and, and how to wire
this all together. And I was

808
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,570
like, well, so then I ran across
this problem that like

809
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,510
microcontrollers. Take, have
logic, voltage and power

810
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:31,770
supplies aren't often different
than that about and so like, but

811
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:35,610
I was like, so do I need a step
down converter? How do I get the

812
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:40,260
signal from my sensor to the
voltage and still keep the

813
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,560
signal going? And I just had, I
was like, how do you search for

814
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,720
that? If you don't even know
what you're searching for?

815
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,600
Right? Yeah, obviously, we had
somebody with more electronics

816
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,030
experience, like know what you
need to look, it's explore

817
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:54,390
voltage divider, and then a bi
directional voltage divider. And

818
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:57,180
that's that circuit that was
like, Oh, great. They gave me

819
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:00,420
the jargon, that I could go
Google to find. And then I can

820
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,880
learn it myself. Right? They
didn't need to sit there and

821
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,190
explain Voltage dividers for me.
I don't need that. And so what

822
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:11,040
it does is it puts less like
previously, when you talked

823
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,160
about how do you incentivize
other entrepreneurs to be

824
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,340
mentors, is if you take this
impetus that they have to

825
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:21,420
explain everything, and do
everything for the students that

826
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,760
instead all they really have to
be available. This is like, Hey,

827
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,820
have you explored the concept of
a voltage divider? Have you

828
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:32,250
explored the concept of, you
know, the Ohms law like what is

829
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,900
this is kind of the thing you
need next, and then the student

830
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,440
goes, looks it up, implements
it, and they have a problem with

831
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,980
that. And so that's where the
change in things and in fact,

832
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,860
our mentors, we're not looking
for people who are experts in

833
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,940
everything. What I'd much rather
have in mentors and teach

834
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,090
students how to do is to be to
learn how to learn.

835
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:59,070
Our best mentors are people who
probably could learn the thing

836
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:04,080
that you The students were doing
the day before. Right? Like, oh,

837
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:07,230
you're you're, you know, we
don't get experts in everything.

838
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:10,410
There's no expert in everything
with robotics, right? So

839
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:12,900
instead, I'd much rather have
somebody who can look up and

840
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,750
say, like, well, I've got the
basics of ROS down, I've done a

841
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:20,340
little bit with machine learning
and computer vision. But I bet

842
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,620
you, we could probably figure
out how to integrate a point

843
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:27,060
cloud and be able to get a depth
map and be able to create that

844
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:30,120
kind of a thing. Right, you
don't have to have someone is

845
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,490
that the but a mentor will be
able to help lead the students

846
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:34,470
and then they do it with them.
And then they all learn

847
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:38,100
together. And that's kind of
where I feel like I'm, I guess

848
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,340
I'd be considered a mentor,
also, because I'm also often in

849
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:46,110
my groups, and learning that,
you know, but that's the real

850
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:50,340
change in it. And it takes a a
thought change a paradigm shift

851
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:53,130
in this, like, I'm gonna sit
here and wait till someone

852
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:57,390
teaches me exactly what I need.
Right? That's where what

853
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,790
education has taught us, like
original education is taught.

854
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:03,090
Yeah, we just have to take the
class to get the thing that we

855
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:06,060
eventually someone's telling us
what we need. Yeah, it's

856
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,160
Audrow Nash: very instead, in a
sense, yeah. Instead,

857
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,350
Dan O'Mara: it's active. You
say, this is the project I'm

858
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:14,190
making? What do I need? Oh, it's
run, you know, it's computer

859
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:17,040
language. It's got a, you know,
it's running Linux. And Oh,

860
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,920
guess what I can control with
Python. I guess I should go take

861
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,400
a weekend course in Python Crash
Course and then write a ROS

862
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,270
node. Right? Yeah. And that,
that's kind of and then I mean,

863
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:29,880
that's kind of how I learned
Python was like, hey, this robot

864
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,380
was cool. It ran on Python. I
guess I should learn that. But I

865
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,900
had not been incentivized to
learn it in my entire life.

866
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,840
Because I was like, Well, why I
don't like websites, I don't

867
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,150
want to run a write another
website, I've got HTML, that's

868
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:45,840
fine. I don't want to write
back. Like, oh, he does cool

869
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,260
things, I want to learn Python.
And it's the same kind of thing

870
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,890
with Project learning where
we've been, you know, I'm sure

871
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:55,500
everyone who's listening to this
has done this in their life is

872
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,320
like it worked on a project,
they haven't known something, so

873
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,680
they had to go learn it. And if
you have that project, like if

874
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,340
you're working with robot arms,
you know, the linear algebra

875
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:09,060
with for inverse kinematics and
all of that stuff, that's a

876
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:14,010
thing you need to kind of know,
a lot of times. And so that was

877
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:16,710
something that, you know, all of
a sudden, we had everybody like

878
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:20,460
looking up and learning doing
doing like linear 100 projects

879
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:25,140
on the side, because they wanted
to, to learn those things. That

880
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,410
you know, so we believe that
instead of going, starting from

881
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:32,220
A to Z, and trying to start with
all the foundational you've ever

882
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,950
you ever need, and then you will
immediately forget and have to

883
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:39,180
relearn anyway, no total, we
just say, hey, when you get to

884
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:42,840
the point that you need this,
you will be incentivized to

885
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,990
learn. And then all of the
foundational knowledge that you

886
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:48,960
need, will start coming in and
you'll be incentivized when

887
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,370
you're actually using. It's a
different way people are, you

888
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:57,270
know, they're not, they're not
these experts in fields, they're

889
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:00,270
people who got a little bit of
everything can probably figure

890
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:01,110
it out along the way.

891
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,860
Audrow Nash: Yeah, I really like
that. It's, it's kind of it's a

892
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:08,310
flip in the hole thinking about
how to learn and how to

893
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:12,180
structure groups to do things,
which I really like. It's like,

894
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:16,230
you put people to work where
they're motivated, because they

895
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:20,640
think it's interesting. And you
have them in this group, where

896
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:25,230
they can ask questions, and they
can contribute where they want.

897
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:28,320
Yeah. And so because of that,
the mentor is really just the

898
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,430
person that gets them unstuck.
Yeah, occasionally, and that's

899
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:35,280
really low overhead for the
mentor, you just need someone

900
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,990
who's like, good at thinking, to
be the mentor. I really like

901
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:43,290
that. It seems like a great
structure. It's like a stable

902
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:47,880
structure for a team to do a
productive, dude, do something

903
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,860
and learn a lot. That sounds
great to me.

904
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:53,580
Dan O'Mara: Yeah. And it creates
a real interesting thing with

905
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:57,030
like, you know, everybody hated
group projects. I know I did in,

906
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:00,180
in school, right? And it was
because the whole power

907
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:05,070
structure in the way that you
were doing things were was

908
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:08,220
really flawed. You know, it was
like, Okay, you guys all don't

909
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,430
want to do this thing. And I'm
gonna make you do this thing.

910
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:14,490
And I'm gonna put you to a bunch
of people also, who don't want

911
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:18,510
to do this thing. And what's the
easiest way out is you give the

912
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:22,980
person you think that will know,
like, who won't say no. And who

913
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,190
doesn't want a bad grade on it,
you force them to do all the

914
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:31,410
work. Right? It's it's horrible,
like social experiment, that bad

915
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:34,470
incentive structure for sure
incentive structure, right?

916
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,560
Where instead our group's people
that come in, and it's like,

917
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,510
well, you get to work on the
thing you actually want to

918
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:43,200
learn, which is great. And then
you become motivated, motivated,

919
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,710
you do a lot of work. And if if
there's literally no one that

920
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:50,700
wants to work on something,
right? That we figure it out,

921
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:54,000
either, you know, everybody gets
together and they do this one

922
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:57,930
thing or that thing to get over
the hump. Right. Yeah. And we

923
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:03,510
all agree to it. or, you know,
use free scope it like, Why does

924
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:09,270
a robot have to have two arms?
Yeah, it doesn't. We just bought

925
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,340
all the parts. And so I was
like, Well, fine. If you guys,

926
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:14,670
you guys don't need a second
arm, but I, well, I bought all

927
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:18,060
the parts, so I'll build it for
you and make it happen. And they

928
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,700
were more interested in the
software and the, you know, the

929
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,880
control systems rather than the
actual hardware at that point.

930
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:28,350
So they weren't forced to do it.
And that's really a crucial part

931
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:32,850
is there is no like, it can be
flexible, a project is flexible,

932
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,710
and it can be developed in a way
that everybody's efforts are

933
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:42,360
working towards the thing that
is awesome. And then then the

934
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,960
things that aren't as awesome,
you at least are motivated to do

935
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,760
them because you understand why
they're important.

936
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,750
Audrow Nash: Yeah, I think I was
thinking about it just now. And

937
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:56,040
it's, I was wondering about like
the unsexy tasks, in a sense,

938
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:00,690
like, as you're saying, and what
it seems to me is that so say

939
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,620
there's this one critic because
often the unsexy tasks might be

940
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:08,010
very important. But people don't
want to do that. Maybe it's like

941
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:16,530
developer ops kind of thing. And
so what I see or what I'm

942
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:18,810
thinking is that with this
structure, what happens is

943
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:22,620
everyone learns basic skill, or
everyone learns skills in what

944
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:25,290
they're interested in. And then
they get to a point where

945
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:28,350
they're fairly good at what
they're like they've learned a

946
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:31,170
good bit, they're fairly
invested in the idea of

947
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:35,700
continuing and then on their
own, maybe, then they can go and

948
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:40,410
they can learn some required
infrastructure or best practices

949
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:44,490
or whatever it might be. But
this has kind of prepared them

950
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:48,270
by giving them enough skill to
get somewhere interesting. So

951
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:54,240
that they might eventually go
over the unsexy task, go and

952
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,080
complete that one.

953
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:57,540
Dan O'Mara: And because it's a
project, right, you know, it's

954
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:02,940
like if the, if the unsexy task
is like, you know, a power

955
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,730
control system like, well,
nothing is gonna run unless you

956
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:10,620
have so that everybody gets
pretty motivated, even for the

957
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:15,720
unsexy tasks to battle notion
when it's a bottleneck and that

958
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,540
they won't get there. And then
and then you're all working

959
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:23,400
collaboratively to split up the
tasks that no one wants to do.

960
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:27,540
Right. And, and that people
volunteer and actually help out

961
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:30,930
with that. And so And there's
usually somebody who, who is

962
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:35,460
excited about learning, like, it
is robotics it is, and somebody

963
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:39,360
understands why, you know, or at
worst, there's someone who's

964
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,760
really good at it, who can
hammer it out way quicker than

965
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,600
anyone else, then everyone else.
Yeah. And then they help other

966
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,140
people do that really quick, you
know, so all of those things are

967
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:52,320
your tools to be able to create
a great group and actually

968
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:57,150
succeed in a project. And, and
learn a whole bunch on the way.

969
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:00,870
But the whole point is, is
unlike business, where it's you,

970
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:05,010
everybody has their silos, well,
what's really created. And

971
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:07,680
that's a bit of a disservice in
the robotics industry, what we

972
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,530
see is, is a lot of our students
are coming that are, you know,

973
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:15,660
automation, engineers, QA, it's
all sorts of like, deep company,

974
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:20,880
like people in larger robotic
civic roles. Yeah. But they want

975
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,490
to learn one's role something
else, because they don't have

976
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:27,240
any of opportunity to do that at
their work. Because, like, the

977
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:31,170
way companies are set up is like
you don't give thought, you

978
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:34,050
know, tasks to somebody who's
not good at them, you give them

979
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:36,600
to this person who's really good
at them. And then that's all

980
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:41,340
they do. Right? But I mean, you
know, it's it, as a business

981
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:45,180
side of things in my brain, I'm
always looking for something

982
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:48,540
that somebody might excel at,
that they don't currently do.

983
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:53,010
Right? Because then you get
happier, better employees that

984
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:57,480
are learning more things, rather
than giving only the things that

985
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,870
are to the people who are good
at, like, we get excited about

986
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:04,770
learning, we want to grow by
employees doing new things, and

987
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,260
what what else might they be
good at that they're not doing

988
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:10,320
right now, then they grow into
new positions and stuff. And

989
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:15,180
it's the same thing, you know,
with with this group, but it but

990
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,610
when you have a lot of people
coming from some of these other

991
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,250
other companies that aren't
doing that they're hungry to

992
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:22,680
learn all the new stuff, and we
want to we want to give them

993
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,190
that opportunity to to learn the
things that they're not good at.

994
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,700
Audrow Nash: What do you think
would happen? If so I understand

995
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:33,900
from a company's perspective,
that desire to specialize people

996
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,430
and have them do the thing
because they're going to be

997
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:40,260
really good at it. And also, you
can kind of pit pay them like

998
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:42,990
the minimum amount because the
majority of their time is on the

999
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:46,770
most specialized, highest value
added thing. Whereas if you pay

1000
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:50,790
them to learn about something
that's irrelevant to whatever it

1001
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:53,940
is that they're most specialize
on. You could think of it as

1002
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:59,100
last time, but as you're saying,
maybe it's they're pivoting into

1003
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:01,410
a thing that they're really
really good at but they're very

1004
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:06,750
happy to do. But I just What
would you think if companies

1005
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:09,570
were to adopt this approach
where maybe like, I don't know,

1006
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:11,850
there's some things where it's
like 20% of your time is your

1007
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:15,510
own for side projects or
something, but what what would a

1008
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:17,910
company look like that did this?
And what do you think the

1009
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:18,720
outcome would be?

1010
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:22,950
Dan O'Mara: Well, I think that,
you know, as a side thing, like,

1011
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:25,950
we have a whole enterprise side
that we would love to be able to

1012
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:28,380
do and have people doing that.
And it's like, that's a really

1013
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,590
easy way that they can provide
that for their students, or for

1014
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:34,290
their employees be like, Hey,
you guys want to learn to get

1015
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:36,810
trained on a whole bunch of
other stuff that has nothing to

1016
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:41,280
do with it? Like, let's put you
through Mechlabs, and then not

1017
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,830
only you're going to gain a lot
of experience, be able to help,

1018
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:47,790
and really pull this back to
your teams and new a new way of

1019
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:51,570
thinking. So that is something
we want to provide for companies

1020
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:56,040
and enterprise as as well. But I
didn't realize that business

1021
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,790
model. Yeah, I mean, but I do
think that that's like companies

1022
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:06,330
getting someone very specialized
is it's important for for speed

1023
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:10,890
and effectiveness, right.
Because obviously, if you want

1024
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:13,530
to build something and get it to
market, you need to be really

1025
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:16,140
fast. And and the fastest way to
do that is to get a whole bunch

1026
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:19,050
of people already know how to do
it. But no one truly knows how

1027
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:23,100
to do it. If we're actually
working on good technology,

1028
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:26,370
right? It's all new. No one's
done it before, if it's

1029
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:31,050
exciting, cool stuff. And so
what we want to do is we want to

1030
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:35,220
foster the, the AI and we want
to foster companies who realize

1031
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:38,700
that it's not what the skills
that people know, that will make

1032
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:42,240
them successful, it's how well
that they they can learn. Right?

1033
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:48,120
And that's like that metric is
something that, you know, we

1034
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,120
really have to train our
companies to look for. And we

1035
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:56,130
have to train our people to be
able to demonstrate. And that's

1036
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:57,030
one metric

1037
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:57,870
Audrow Nash: explicitly,

1038
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:02,430
Dan O'Mara: how how, how easily,
like how quickly you can learn

1039
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:03,000
to learn?

1040
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,460
Audrow Nash: Oh, yeah,
definitely. I think it's so

1041
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,580
valuable, right? For sure. And
it's something that by keeping

1042
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:11,280
that muscle strong, it seems so
valuable.

1043
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,160
Dan O'Mara: Absolutely. Because
you want somebody who can figure

1044
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,910
things out and learn how to
learn a new skill yet, if you

1045
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:20,010
put them doing the same thing
all the time, that just that

1046
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:24,450
they're good at, and they aren't
as good at learning. You know,

1047
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,080
you get your job done, but you
don't, like succeed if that job

1048
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:28,650
changes.

1049
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,860
Audrow Nash: Yeah. And I think
also over time, if people are

1050
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:35,370
not engaged in their work, they
start slowly falling behind,

1051
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:38,460
because they were really
specialized ones. But the jobs

1052
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,070
responsibilities are a moving
target, and they're moving away

1053
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:44,340
from their core competences.
Yeah. So

1054
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:48,090
Dan O'Mara: you have to if I'm
not learning something new, or

1055
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:52,920
like, growing in something that
I'm doing in some way, I get

1056
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:57,330
really bored. Right, yeah,
that's why I've been, you know,

1057
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:01,860
I've been a weird employee to
hire in many ways, because I

1058
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,890
went through so many things that
are so many has, like my resume,

1059
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:10,500
bizarre looking, right. I have a
degree in ethnobotany. And I do

1060
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:15,270
robot interest now. You know,
it's, like, what, but I know,

1061
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:19,590
it's bad. And so basically, I
just created a, like an

1062
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:22,500
education program that can
justify the way that I like to

1063
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:26,820
learn. That's really what we've
done. I just feel like, you

1064
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:29,820
know, I'm good at learning
things. And I can get to that,

1065
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:33,780
like, 80% of competency really
quickly, pretty quick, you know,

1066
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:37,590
and so I wanted to be able to
help people who are interested

1067
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:41,160
in not only that, like learning
that last top 20%, but also the

1068
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:44,010
people who want to get up to
that at that first 80% quickly.

1069
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:48,210
And, you know, realizing
robotics is something that's

1070
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:51,600
changing so quick. And like the
the last five years, the

1071
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,410
availability of hardware, that
at a low price point that you

1072
01:03:55,410 --> 01:04:00,090
can start building at has just
exploded, right. Yeah, think of

1073
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,910
all of the like, you know, it's
like, right now we're getting

1074
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:07,590
little, the, like the Itsy Bitsy
and the feathers and the you

1075
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:11,010
know, all of the cool stuff from
Adafruit, the microcontrollers

1076
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:15,600
that not only now use, you know,
Arduino and see but they also

1077
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,600
you could do circuit Python. And
so basically, you can take a

1078
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,840
weekend workshop to learn
Python, you can you can take a

1079
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:25,380
microcontroller with and use
that Python on it, you know, and

1080
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:29,790
then in a very short time, you
can be writing, we're doing

1081
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:34,080
robotics code, and bad code, and
making sensors work and building

1082
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:38,430
this stuff for you know, so
cool. You know, so much less

1083
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:42,840
than what we used to have to pay
to get into robotics, right? You

1084
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,930
don't have to have a platform
like Ricci to understand

1085
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:48,900
robotics anymore. Like you could
there's so much more remember

1086
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,510
when bait like if you'd wanted
to make a robot, just a simple

1087
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:55,800
base with a couple of wheels,
and they hundreds of dollars,

1088
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:58,740
you know, and now you can, you
know, obviously you get what you

1089
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:02,190
pay for it but you can You can
buy a $30 kit on Amazon and have

1090
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:05,610
a base of a robot that you can
put the Asbury pie on, and put

1091
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,850
ROS on and then beat then put a
camera on and you know, under

1092
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:12,750
$150, you could actually be
having a full like ROS

1093
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:14,970
implemented computer vision
robot.

1094
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:19,950
Audrow Nash: Oh, totally. Yeah,
no. I just, I just spoke with

1095
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:25,080
our friends from Meg Dang, who
does the spot mini looking robot

1096
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:29,730
mini buffer. And like, that's a
quadra pet for $500 that has

1097
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:32,730
pretty sophisticated sensors and
a Raspberry Pi. Like, that's so

1098
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:36,570
cool. That's totally new, like
buying a quadra pet at an

1099
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:40,680
affordable price. Exactly. Like,
unbelievable. Yeah, and you're

1100
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,180
right, yeah, the explosion of
hardware, it's

1101
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:45,600
Dan O'Mara: moving so fast.
Right. And right now is the time

1102
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,870
to get deeper in robotics or
learn other things in robotics,

1103
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:53,370
because it's so much like the
availability of learn this stuff

1104
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:57,450
is finally to anyone, you don't
have to be, you know, a

1105
01:05:57,450 --> 01:06:02,910
researcher, you know, when
million dollar lab to learn, you

1106
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:07,380
know, inverse kinematics with a
with arms, you know, 3d printed

1107
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:10,770
with a few few stepper motors,
and, you know, you could be

1108
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:13,440
learning it for less than than
$100.

1109
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:18,210
Audrow Nash: Yeah, it's not
going back to thinking about

1110
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:22,380
corporations or like larger
businesses and having them do

1111
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:29,100
something similar to your
courses. One, one thing, one

1112
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:32,970
challenge that I could imagine
is that if the people don't want

1113
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:37,290
to be there, because you have,
it's sort of a biased group that

1114
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:41,550
comes to you for these courses,
where they're all really engaged

1115
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:43,950
and very excited to do it for
themselves, like they're

1116
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:48,210
literally paying their own money
to spend their time learning and

1117
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:53,460
working with you on some
projects. How do you imagine it?

1118
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:57,360
Would I just What do you think
about the idea of people having

1119
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:01,830
their company send them to this
kind of time? Where they would

1120
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:04,560
work on something in line with
the projects we've been

1121
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:05,160
discussing?

1122
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:10,830
Dan O'Mara: Yeah, absolutely. I
mean, the part of it is, is

1123
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:15,630
that, you know, as we have to
make it fun, we have to make it

1124
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:17,790
interesting. That's kind of the
point is, is that and that's

1125
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:22,080
scoping those projects, right?
Yep. So 14 projects, you know,

1126
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:24,780
we do have to make a fun and
interesting project that people

1127
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:28,200
are going to be excited about,
right? If someone really doesn't

1128
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,920
want to be there. Like, we can
also think can just sit the

1129
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,700
corner and read their phone if
they want, like, I'm talking.

1130
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:39,420
Like, if they want to
contribute, they can. And the

1131
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:42,120
way our programs are, is there's
no one's relying on like the

1132
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:45,240
fifth person who's breathing his
phone to get the job done.

1133
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:51,450
Right. You know, and so we did a
program just yesterday for a

1134
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:55,620
Brazilian Innovation Tour
Company that that brought in

1135
01:07:56,010 --> 01:08:00,480
about 3030 students all have
different corporate backgrounds,

1136
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,190
who had not no robotics
experience, per se. And we

1137
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:09,210
brought them in, set them down
on a little platform, which is a

1138
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:12,090
I don't know if you've seen
their polo zumo bots, they are.

1139
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:17,550
Audrow Nash: Yep, use them as
like a sumo thing. Yeah. Robots,

1140
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:20,040
Dan O'Mara: but they have an IMU
they have proximity sensors,

1141
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,460
they have line following they
have, they have all of these

1142
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:28,530
things, and an example library.
And so we basically set them up,

1143
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:32,520
I made a quick tutorial on the,
you know, on our wiki, and I

1144
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,340
said, you know, this is, you
guys are going to figure this

1145
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:37,860
out. So you're going to learn
how to connect the robot, you're

1146
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:40,770
gonna learn how to install your
IDE, you're gonna learn how to,

1147
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:44,760
to load it up and understand
that all the things that you

1148
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:48,450
want to pull your hair out with
Arduinos. And like, I don't like

1149
01:08:48,450 --> 01:08:51,870
it, the Comm port, where do I
find the library. And so we made

1150
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:54,270
some of the tutorials to make
that easier, but we put them

1151
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:57,930
through the paces, and then let
them explore all the examples.

1152
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:02,130
And we said, hey, there might be
a fighting robot example, in

1153
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:07,470
there somewhere, see if you can
figure it out. And they all did.

1154
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:10,530
And then we let them decorate
the robots. And then and then we

1155
01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:14,310
had a big tournament of a
battling, you know, bots. And so

1156
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:17,400
these, you know, and they got a
chance, if they wanted to get

1157
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,770
into the code and learn a little
bit of coding, they could do

1158
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:21,960
that if they wanted to play
around, you know, with the

1159
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:25,500
hardware, like they could do
that. And so that that's really

1160
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:29,790
the thing is, is to like, you
know, aim it at wherever, you

1161
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:32,790
know, we're not going to get
them into the you know, the deep

1162
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:36,330
math and deep coding of stuff if
it's if that's not where, where

1163
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:41,130
they need to be. But having a
cool product like if you are

1164
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:45,450
Bible is the project, you build
it to learn it. If you get a

1165
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:47,730
good project, there will be
something there that will

1166
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:50,730
interest most people and if it
really doesn't interest them at

1167
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:54,810
all. It doesn't hurt them to be
on their phone over there to

1168
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:58,080
help in any way that they do.
Like we often we occasionally

1169
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:02,580
have students that that fall off
the, you know, fall off the

1170
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:05,670
beaten path a little bit and so
that we have to pull them back

1171
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:09,720
in, or they don't contribute as
much. But the way it works is

1172
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,430
they get what they need and what
they put in.

1173
01:10:12,599 --> 01:10:16,229
Audrow Nash: Oh, definitely.
Let's see. So you were speaking

1174
01:10:16,229 --> 01:10:20,729
about tutorials over earlier?
Can you tell me a bit about

1175
01:10:20,729 --> 01:10:23,969
having students? Because it
sounds like it's one of the

1176
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:28,619
like, few things that you're
taking more of an active stance

1177
01:10:28,619 --> 01:10:31,679
and encouraging students to do
in the program? Would you tell

1178
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,519
me a bit about that?

1179
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:38,580
Dan O'Mara: Sure. So a lot of it
is is like understanding the

1180
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:42,150
process of accountability,
right? With a project based

1181
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:45,450
program? The big question is
like, Well, why don't I just do

1182
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:51,360
it myself? Right. And rightly,
so if that's like, we want you

1183
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,700
to learn it yourself. And we
want you to grow those things

1184
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:59,070
like that. And a lot of people
can. But we also want to offer

1185
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,340
the points for like, a, when you
get stuck, you have mentors, and

1186
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:04,800
you have people who can help
you, right. And that's what you

1187
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,800
don't have doing your product on
your own. And we all get stuck,

1188
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:12,090
right? The other side of it is
is the, you need some kind of

1189
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:15,930
structure of accountability,
right? We all know that we were,

1190
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:18,870
there's no way that we're going
to continue going to the gym, if

1191
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:24,870
we, if it were a pay by the day
kind of thing. Right? The fact

1192
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:27,630
that we've paid for them on and
we have to go to the gym, that's

1193
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:30,480
the only way that really gets us
to go to the gym sometimes,

1194
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:34,050
right? And so you have to create
some levels of structures of

1195
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:37,590
accountability. And so
documentation is one of those

1196
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:41,160
things that we just found. You
know, I'd like to say everybody,

1197
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,680
but there I have some people
that like I love documentation

1198
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:49,170
that like good to help us with,
right? Because most people don't

1199
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:53,040
do well with writing
documentation. Right? They're

1200
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,110
great on building stuff, but
they don't want to document it.

1201
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:01,200
And so part of the, the learning
process for, you know, the

1202
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:06,300
classic thing is, is the, you
know, show and demonstrate and

1203
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:09,120
then involve the other person
into learning, like, that's the

1204
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,060
classic way of teaching
something, right? Yeah, well, in

1205
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:17,130
this situation where, you know,
it's a little bit flipped,

1206
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:21,450
right, you're learning it along
with them. It's like the, the

1207
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:24,180
demonstrate and the teach
someone else, what you're

1208
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:27,720
learning is part of that
documentation process. All of

1209
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:31,650
those put together creates
accountability, it creates a

1210
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:36,570
ability for people to ingrain
what they've learned, because

1211
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:39,990
they have to explain it. And
then it's documented so that

1212
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:43,860
when other people need that
information, it can be there, as

1213
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,160
well as when we need that
information. You know, they say

1214
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:50,610
documentation is a love letter
to your future self. Yeah,

1215
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:54,150
definitely. It is. And so it's
super important. And so we

1216
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:58,500
that's, that's one of those
unsexy things that we, you know,

1217
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:04,770
we require people to do. And so
that that's just one really

1218
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:08,580
important thing we found that
really helps on so many levels,

1219
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:11,490
that we want to make sure that
it's it's part of every single

1220
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,740
person's like, kind of
requirements to that.

1221
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,340
Audrow Nash: Are there any other
requirements that you have? Or

1222
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:20,520
is that really like? I mean, you
show up at certain times, and

1223
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:24,630
you have like, these are the
hours we'll be all together. But

1224
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:30,690
other than that, is there any
real hard structure in the whole

1225
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:31,380
program?

1226
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:34,770
Dan O'Mara: Well, there's a lot
of structure, but requirements,

1227
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,070
like, don't have any other
requirements. We don't have any,

1228
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,540
like, you know, school is filled
with prerequisites, right? You

1229
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:44,940
can't take this unless you've
taken this and you can't take

1230
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:48,960
this. And, you know, I don't
know about you, but I opened

1231
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,000
right up to the back page of the
manual. But I want to take all

1232
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,600
of that, like I really, four or
500 classes. That's what I want

1233
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,450
Audrow Nash: to take those
interesting ones. Yeah. Why do I

1234
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:57,630
have

1235
01:13:57,629 --> 01:14:02,579
Dan O'Mara: to take Intro to
Computers? Like, really? Like,

1236
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:09,539
I've been using computers, thank
you. And like, so we realize,

1237
01:14:09,569 --> 01:14:13,439
like, there are no prerequisites
we do for our team programs, we

1238
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:18,689
do choose people that have a we
need to have one skill in strong

1239
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:22,379
the team that not have been
strong, but you need to have a

1240
01:14:22,379 --> 01:14:26,369
bear like your competence, you
have to have some competency in

1241
01:14:26,369 --> 01:14:30,509
one of the fields that is needed
to complete this project. And

1242
01:14:30,509 --> 01:14:33,749
so, and again, you don't even
have to do those things. But we

1243
01:14:33,749 --> 01:14:37,409
do want to piece in your
resource for the group. And so

1244
01:14:37,409 --> 01:14:40,049
we try to match people in that
and if there's really truly a

1245
01:14:40,049 --> 01:14:44,099
spot that has no competency in
that area, that's where we'll

1246
01:14:44,099 --> 01:14:49,709
bring a mentor and to be able to
help sense that there. And so

1247
01:14:49,709 --> 01:14:53,399
for our team levels, it's the
our one requirement is that you

1248
01:14:53,399 --> 01:14:56,069
have some competency and some
level of that and we can be

1249
01:14:56,069 --> 01:14:58,709
pretty loose with that if you're
a maker and you've done a lot of

1250
01:14:58,709 --> 01:15:00,839
CAD to be 3d print But you've
never done anything

1251
01:15:00,839 --> 01:15:04,469
professionally or you've never
done a bunch of other things

1252
01:15:04,469 --> 01:15:06,899
with it, that's still really
valuable. Because we find that

1253
01:15:06,899 --> 01:15:09,779
you've learned that thing. It's
that like, what did you get

1254
01:15:09,779 --> 01:15:14,009
expert T said, we just want you
to have some expertise in

1255
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:17,849
something, so that we know that
you, you can can do that. And

1256
01:15:17,849 --> 01:15:22,319
that helps with the team project
for the individualized project,

1257
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:24,809
there are no requirements, you
can come in as green as you

1258
01:15:24,809 --> 01:15:29,969
could possibly be. And, and it's
really amazing, because you do

1259
01:15:29,969 --> 01:15:33,389
see, you know, it's not just the
people who are, you know,

1260
01:15:33,419 --> 01:15:37,379
experts getting other be like,
there's so many things that this

1261
01:15:37,379 --> 01:15:40,139
person, for example, that person
who's really green in robotics,

1262
01:15:40,289 --> 01:15:43,439
has really good business sense.
And this other person who is an

1263
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:46,379
electrical engineer, is now
learning about basic marketing

1264
01:15:46,379 --> 01:15:49,649
for the very first time, you can
contribute to their basic

1265
01:15:49,649 --> 01:15:52,649
marketing, right, like, yeah,
and that ends up being still

1266
01:15:52,649 --> 01:15:57,209
really valuable because of this
community thing. So we, we just

1267
01:15:57,209 --> 01:16:01,949
kind of say, forget the
prerequisites. You know, most

1268
01:16:01,949 --> 01:16:04,649
people have some level of
something there, and then they

1269
01:16:04,649 --> 01:16:08,039
can join us, or we can help put
them into a group, maybe you're

1270
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:13,229
not jumping into the deep object
orientation and grasping class,

1271
01:16:13,349 --> 01:16:17,729
you're working on the mini, you
know, DIY pup, you know, mini

1272
01:16:17,729 --> 01:16:20,909
pumper where you're, you know,
just working with Raspberry Pi,

1273
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:23,459
that some of those things. So,
you know, it's, it's about

1274
01:16:23,459 --> 01:16:25,829
scoping the people for the prior
matching the people for the

1275
01:16:25,829 --> 01:16:30,719
project to those that we don't,
other requirements is just you

1276
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:34,889
need to show up at sessions. But
we also have a really cool way

1277
01:16:34,919 --> 01:16:38,519
of doing an asynchronous thanks.
So we have even talked about how

1278
01:16:38,759 --> 01:16:41,399
this whole like you actually
asked earlier, how do you scale

1279
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:43,409
this, and I don't think we got
to that right.

1280
01:16:43,529 --> 01:16:46,349
Audrow Nash: Now I definitely
want to talk about it, you can

1281
01:16:46,349 --> 01:16:47,489
do the

1282
01:16:47,489 --> 01:16:52,559
Dan O'Mara: scaling is that this
is all a hybrid model. Not only

1283
01:16:52,559 --> 01:16:56,159
can you be in person, but you
can do this completely remote.

1284
01:16:56,999 --> 01:17:00,239
Right, that's all. So that's how
we scale a lot of this group.

1285
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,389
And we found so it can be
literally double the amount of

1286
01:17:03,389 --> 01:17:07,739
students because we can do half
in person and half out of, you

1287
01:17:07,739 --> 01:17:13,229
know, being completely virtual.
And then even so our facility

1288
01:17:13,229 --> 01:17:16,439
wise of this, even our students
who are in person, they don't

1289
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:21,299
need to be here doing things all
the time. If we're at a meeting,

1290
01:17:21,329 --> 01:17:23,489
like we're having a Zoom
meeting, there's no point in us

1291
01:17:23,489 --> 01:17:26,999
all being in in one room. And,
and so they can all be home and

1292
01:17:26,999 --> 01:17:30,569
like, you know, in their
bathrobe, doing it doing a

1293
01:17:30,569 --> 01:17:34,139
project planning project. And
some people might come into the

1294
01:17:34,139 --> 01:17:38,309
lab. And so that's how we really
scale this is that you create a

1295
01:17:38,309 --> 01:17:41,729
hands on experience, even if you
don't have an experience now and

1296
01:17:41,729 --> 01:17:46,679
I'd like to tell this quick
story about Noelle who is one of

1297
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:50,279
our Argentinian students. He
lived in Argentina. And he was

1298
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:53,399
an automation engineer, but he
had never done cat never done

1299
01:17:53,399 --> 01:17:58,379
any type of cat design. And, you
know, just like, like, this is

1300
01:17:58,379 --> 01:18:01,139
something I want to learn. But I
just again, he's like, Well, do

1301
01:18:01,139 --> 01:18:04,529
I go back to school for this? Do
I take a course to learn how to

1302
01:18:04,529 --> 01:18:08,159
use basics, I've never had
anything fun to make. Right. And

1303
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:12,839
so now we're like, hey, so the
the neck piece of this was

1304
01:18:12,839 --> 01:18:17,189
originally scoped with the Paul
on robotics as this really

1305
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:20,339
fascinating but very intricate
mechanism where it was a three

1306
01:18:20,339 --> 01:18:25,529
degree of freedom system that
was called the orbiter, it was

1307
01:18:25,529 --> 01:18:28,499
really cool. It was a little
outside of what we were going to

1308
01:18:28,499 --> 01:18:32,399
build and recreate. So we just
put a pan tilt servo in there.

1309
01:18:32,789 --> 01:18:35,579
But all of this had been
designed. And so we needed to

1310
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:39,209
actually design the mounting of
those servos into the program.

1311
01:18:39,209 --> 01:18:43,139
So we needed somebody to Cat up
the whole structural mechanism

1312
01:18:43,139 --> 01:18:46,589
to hold that. And so he was
like, Oh, I'd love to learn CAD.

1313
01:18:46,649 --> 01:18:50,309
So I literally went on a, you
know, a call with him spent 20

1314
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:53,039
minutes to be like here, this is
how you set up your components

1315
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:57,929
and your you know, your your
components and your parts in

1316
01:18:57,929 --> 01:19:01,199
Fusion 360 so that you can be
successful, here's how you turn

1317
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:04,859
on your device, you know, your,
your actual changes history so

1318
01:19:04,859 --> 01:19:08,099
that you can get back to things.
And here's like two other tips.

1319
01:19:08,429 --> 01:19:12,269
Here are the models for the
servos that you could put in and

1320
01:19:12,269 --> 01:19:16,109
this is how you put them in. And
now I want you to build this.

1321
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:19,649
Right yeah. And it gave him kind
of the specs of what what we

1322
01:19:19,649 --> 01:19:22,739
want to hear the measurements.
There's that he you know, he

1323
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:26,819
went home and by the very next
night had built something. And

1324
01:19:26,819 --> 01:19:30,539
so he put it on our 3d printers
over the air. And so it was

1325
01:19:30,539 --> 01:19:34,109
literally printing out in the
morning when I came in. I come

1326
01:19:34,109 --> 01:19:37,139
in, I hand it to the team, they
assemble it for him, they give

1327
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:42,179
him notes. He goes back and re
revive designs it and it's like

1328
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:46,589
he's hands on calving and 3d
printing. He's just not

1329
01:19:46,709 --> 01:19:51,119
necessarily touching the thing.
Which is incredible. So he

1330
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:55,049
basically learned to CAD better
than most of us in two weeks.

1331
01:19:55,469 --> 01:19:59,519
That's awesome. Right and manage
managed to do all the things

1332
01:19:59,519 --> 01:20:02,039
that we needed. So that's kind
of the process is like, you

1333
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:04,349
know, you have something cool
that you need somebody who wants

1334
01:20:04,349 --> 01:20:08,009
to learn it. And even if they're
completely virtual, you know,

1335
01:20:08,039 --> 01:20:12,209
they can buy, you know, a
cheaper robot, a servo and a

1336
01:20:12,209 --> 01:20:14,699
control module and then start
working on the code to control

1337
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:17,399
that and understanding it, even
hands on at their desk, that

1338
01:20:17,399 --> 01:20:20,429
then that code can go and be
uploaded into our project and

1339
01:20:20,429 --> 01:20:24,689
work in a much bigger system. So
yeah, you kind of on a micro

1340
01:20:24,689 --> 01:20:28,649
level do quite a bit hands on,
even if you're not in our lab,

1341
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:34,049
then in most of our programming,
like a lot of our programmers,

1342
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:36,839
that we're mostly interested in
just doing the code for the

1343
01:20:36,839 --> 01:20:39,779
robot, they didn't even come
into the lab, they were working

1344
01:20:39,779 --> 01:20:42,929
with everybody, but we'd have
them up on the big screen and

1345
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:46,049
talking to them. And they would
be uploading code and

1346
01:20:46,049 --> 01:20:50,459
controlling the robot from their
home. That's so cool, right? And

1347
01:20:50,459 --> 01:20:53,609
being able to test this, while
we're all working on this, you

1348
01:20:53,609 --> 01:20:59,009
know, it becomes like, we aren't
limited anymore to in, in, in

1349
01:20:59,009 --> 01:21:04,079
classroom, you know, experience,
the pandemic is taught like this

1350
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:07,019
was developed during our
pandemic, because we were like,

1351
01:21:07,019 --> 01:21:09,779
well, we can't wait, we need to
create this amazing program for

1352
01:21:09,779 --> 01:21:13,619
people now. And the pandemic
shows just how well we can be

1353
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:17,399
able to do that and what the
limitations are, as well. But

1354
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:20,999
yeah, allows us to create a
system where we can scale this.

1355
01:21:21,689 --> 01:21:25,889
And the actual in you can be
hands on without necessarily

1356
01:21:25,889 --> 01:21:29,069
having to be in a school, nine
to five every single day.

1357
01:21:29,639 --> 01:21:33,269
Audrow Nash: Yeah, definitely.
Yeah, it's so interesting. To

1358
01:21:33,269 --> 01:21:37,589
me, it seems like the whole
approach that you're taking in

1359
01:21:37,589 --> 01:21:42,599
this, how do you call it again,
Mechi, or with labs, Mechlabs,

1360
01:21:42,929 --> 01:21:47,129
the whole approach you're taking
in the Mechlabs, course, or

1361
01:21:47,129 --> 01:21:51,269
program? It seems like, I'm
comparing it in my head to like

1362
01:21:51,269 --> 01:21:55,109
universities, or these kinds of
things, where it seems like they

1363
01:21:55,109 --> 01:21:57,869
go against a lot. So for
example, people have to take

1364
01:21:57,869 --> 01:22:00,869
courses they're not motivated to
do, you have to learn things

1365
01:22:00,869 --> 01:22:04,529
that are kind of abstract, and
not directly applicable to what

1366
01:22:04,529 --> 01:22:06,449
you're working on, or what
you're even interested in. But

1367
01:22:06,449 --> 01:22:10,559
it's like a to z learning, as
you were saying. They have a

1368
01:22:10,559 --> 01:22:13,979
rigorous measures in place for
accountability, like all the

1369
01:22:13,979 --> 01:22:17,429
exams, and things like this, and
the like hierarchy that forms

1370
01:22:17,429 --> 01:22:21,989
from all of that. Whereas you
guys, and also then they have

1371
01:22:22,019 --> 01:22:26,549
they have the high paid lectures
relatively. They have the

1372
01:22:26,579 --> 01:22:31,199
intricate infrastructure around
like TAs and graders, and all of

1373
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:31,979
this kind of thing,

1374
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:34,800
Dan O'Mara: multimillion dollar
labs that very few people can

1375
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,880
access that money. Yeah,

1376
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:39,060
Audrow Nash: that's totally
true, too. And so you guys kind

1377
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:42,180
of took everything and you
flipped it on its head. And so

1378
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:47,280
it's like, people are motivated
to do whatever it is, you need

1379
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:50,850
very little of an expert's time.
Those are your advisors and

1380
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:54,720
mentors. The people it's like,
if they want to disengage,

1381
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:57,480
that's totally fine. But for the
most part, they're doing it

1382
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,350
because they're totally
interested in it. Yep. It's very

1383
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:03,270
interesting. And then the
accountability with

1384
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:06,660
documentation, providing it so
that it's good for them in the

1385
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:09,570
future, it's good for you to
build off of their work. And

1386
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:14,130
it's helping them kind of skill
up in how they communicate, and

1387
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:18,720
also in their own understanding,
by leveraging the idea that they

1388
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:22,860
teach, to learn because they are
writing documentation, teaching

1389
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:25,980
it to their future selves, or
whoever their reader may be.

1390
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:31,440
readers may be, it feels very
clever to me. With all this,

1391
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,050
it's like you're working with
the grain of human nature very

1392
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:38,760
well, as opposed to other
structures is how I'm thinking

1393
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,330
of it now.

1394
01:23:40,019 --> 01:23:44,519
Dan O'Mara: Well, it's like, we
we develop something that we

1395
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:48,749
wanted to learn from, and how
we've kind of learned these

1396
01:23:48,749 --> 01:23:51,659
things, right. And so it's,
that's been modeled on that. And

1397
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:54,209
then, you know, we put it to
test we got groups of people,

1398
01:23:54,209 --> 01:23:57,119
we, we built this stuff, and
said, Hey, this is where we

1399
01:23:57,119 --> 01:23:59,819
refined over time, and we
refined it with all of this is a

1400
01:23:59,819 --> 01:24:03,029
giant experiment as well. And
we're going to continue to grow.

1401
01:24:03,029 --> 01:24:06,599
One of the things we hope to do
is micro credentialing with like

1402
01:24:06,599 --> 01:24:10,769
NFT badges where if you were
actually you own your

1403
01:24:10,769 --> 01:24:13,949
certificate, and you can
demonstrate value along with,

1404
01:24:14,129 --> 01:24:17,249
you know, we can say, hey, you
know, you want to get a badge in

1405
01:24:18,599 --> 01:24:22,439
motor control theory, right,
your project is right in there,

1406
01:24:22,439 --> 01:24:24,989
all you have to do is is maybe
hit a few of these other kinds

1407
01:24:24,989 --> 01:24:27,959
of things and demonstrate that
in your project, and you will

1408
01:24:27,959 --> 01:24:30,629
earn this badge, and then you
can put that on your LinkedIn

1409
01:24:30,629 --> 01:24:33,899
and your resume and everything
else. Right. Yeah. Other stuff

1410
01:24:33,899 --> 01:24:36,839
that we hope is is that we'd
like to create even a reward

1411
01:24:36,839 --> 01:24:40,709
structure structure based around
a crypto coin, where you can be

1412
01:24:40,709 --> 01:24:44,129
able to somewhat like a miles
program, you know, you're in a

1413
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:48,269
in a program and you're you're
actually learning and you get

1414
01:24:48,269 --> 01:24:52,949
rewarded by a crypto token. And
then as you go through there,

1415
01:24:52,949 --> 01:24:56,369
you're actually being able to
find like, earn your way through

1416
01:24:56,489 --> 01:24:59,729
your program and, and you know,
if it ever becomes successful,

1417
01:24:59,729 --> 01:25:02,309
and we're something maybe that
crypto pays for your entire

1418
01:25:02,309 --> 01:25:05,609
education itself just by you
learning, right? That would be

1419
01:25:05,609 --> 01:25:08,399
super cool, throw everything up
into the air and say, Hey, we've

1420
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:13,109
just run radicalized all of this
education system by, you know,

1421
01:25:13,259 --> 01:25:15,569
that and if it's worth nothing,
at least you get an education.

1422
01:25:15,599 --> 01:25:16,619
So, yeah.

1423
01:25:16,949 --> 01:25:19,019
Audrow Nash: And you guys had
fun making a cryptocurrency?

1424
01:25:19,019 --> 01:25:19,229
Yeah,

1425
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:22,350
Dan O'Mara: exactly. So like
there's, there's a lot of really

1426
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:24,840
interesting things that we hope
will come down the pipeline as

1427
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,870
we as we build this and and
experiment with it. And we're

1428
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:32,160
excited to have people who come
and be part of this journey with

1429
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:32,640
us.

1430
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:38,760
Audrow Nash: What do you think
is the role of typical? Like, I

1431
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:43,020
mean, I guess K through 12
education, but then university

1432
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:49,830
education? And like, how does
all that relate to this? Can it

1433
01:25:49,830 --> 01:25:54,510
supplemented? Is it meant to be
torn down by this is like, Where

1434
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:55,200
does it all fit?

1435
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,200
Dan O'Mara: I think it can fit
both. I mean, you know, right

1436
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:01,590
now, I would say that it's a
great supplement, to, you know,

1437
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:04,860
an engineering degree to get
actual hands on experience and

1438
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:08,550
portfolio projects. Electronics
degree, I mean, any of those

1439
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:11,760
degrees, you can you will gain
by joining a program like this,

1440
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:15,960
we, you know, we have
aspirations in 10 years to maybe

1441
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:20,790
make actual universities just
not as relevant, you know,

1442
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:25,170
relevant. I mean, who knows,
maybe we can do it. Like we'd

1443
01:26:25,170 --> 01:26:27,900
like to, that's what we're
shooting for. I mean, you know,

1444
01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:32,520
how we see a problem. And we
think that our solution can do a

1445
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:36,120
lot for things. And it doesn't
mean that we're also just

1446
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,790
because I say, that doesn't mean
that we're not open to like,

1447
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:41,790
hey, you know, you're we can
partnership with universities,

1448
01:26:41,790 --> 01:26:44,580
we have partnership with
programs and boot camps. And,

1449
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:47,430
you know, you're learning and
embedded embedded programming

1450
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:50,790
bootcamp, right, we can be able
to provide the hardware and the

1451
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:53,970
projects that you could actually
cut your teeth on even virtually

1452
01:26:53,970 --> 01:26:57,570
right. And so that, you know,
all of those things can be

1453
01:26:57,570 --> 01:27:02,040
possible. And so the, there's a
lot of opportunity for us to

1454
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:05,820
create good partnerships and
work with organizations as per,

1455
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:09,090
you know, we're focused mostly
on, you know, 16, to 18 year

1456
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:11,670
olds, and up, we're looking for
kind of, you know, post high

1457
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:14,970
school graduate, we get a lot of
people who are already

1458
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:19,050
graduated. And we keep seeing
this like this. The sad part is,

1459
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:22,800
we also see a lot of people who
are experts, so called experts,

1460
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,800
we get the literally on paper,
and we see like, wow, why are

1461
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,860
they even taking this course?
It's like, they don't know why

1462
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:32,790
paper, they're great. But you
know, time after time, I can't

1463
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:36,720
tell you how many masters of
mechanical engineering degree,

1464
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:40,770
you know, people that we've come
in, and they can't cap their way

1465
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:44,820
out of a paperback. Yep. Right.
Like, there are some really

1466
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:49,800
basic skills that are not being
taught by these programs, then,

1467
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:54,210
that we need, right? And what
they need the most out of

1468
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:56,640
anything, regardless of what
whether they're good academy or

1469
01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:00,570
not. They need practical
projects to learn from you need,

1470
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,960
like you have to do the thing.
It like we live in a world where

1471
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:08,190
you can learn to be an expert
woodworker on YouTube. Yeah,

1472
01:28:08,190 --> 01:28:11,550
it's not but unless you actually
do the woodworking he won't give

1473
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:16,890
it. So you can learn to be an
expert, you can know all the

1474
01:28:16,890 --> 01:28:20,730
things you can collect all the
knowledge. Yeah, but you have to

1475
01:28:20,730 --> 01:28:23,550
do it. And that's that
everything. It's the builder to

1476
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:27,960
learn it approach is what we we
think, is the way of the future.

1477
01:28:28,739 --> 01:28:32,519
Audrow Nash: Definitely. Yeah, I
had a professor, at some point

1478
01:28:32,519 --> 01:28:35,819
that we used to say something
like I can watch all the golf on

1479
01:28:35,819 --> 01:28:39,059
TV, but it doesn't make me any
better at golf, this kind of

1480
01:28:39,059 --> 01:28:42,209
thing. Same with watching all
the woodworking videos,

1481
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:45,540
Dan O'Mara: and all the college
courses and all this to all of

1482
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:48,960
the lectures in the world of all
the things but it's not going to

1483
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,720
make you an expert in those
things. The only way you get to

1484
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:55,440
be good at these things is
actually just doing and yeah, in

1485
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:58,800
failing out of it been learning.
Oh, totally. You know, all of

1486
01:28:58,800 --> 01:28:59,850
that part of the process?

1487
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:05,069
Audrow Nash: Yeah, I think it's
really important to me to try to

1488
01:29:05,069 --> 01:29:07,739
build something and then by
trying to build it, you see the

1489
01:29:07,739 --> 01:29:12,329
limitations, you see where it's
difficult, you see why you can't

1490
01:29:12,329 --> 01:29:14,849
do the first thing you wanted to
do immediately. And then you

1491
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:18,269
start to think creatively and
learn the skills to keep

1492
01:29:18,269 --> 01:29:23,309
growing. It's a wonderful check
on reality or on yourself with

1493
01:29:23,309 --> 01:29:28,079
reality. So just cutting their
teeth on actual projects. It

1494
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:32,099
sounds like a wonderful thing
for your students. Were so you

1495
01:29:32,099 --> 01:29:35,729
mentioned expansion, like
looking at different areas. Can

1496
01:29:35,729 --> 01:29:37,589
you tell me a bit about your
expansion plans.

1497
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:42,060
Dan O'Mara: So right now we are
looking to expand more circuit

1498
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:46,560
launch locations, expand more
labs for Mechlabs, kind of

1499
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:51,210
we've the we're in the middle of
a funding round that will allow

1500
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:54,180
us to to be able to do that. Of
course a lot of because we are

1501
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:57,030
dealing with space, there's a
lot of like kind of long term

1502
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:59,880
planning that has to happen when
you open spaces and everything

1503
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:03,810
else. So we are exploring a lot
of things from working with

1504
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:06,150
governments to be able to
provide economic centers of

1505
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:10,290
innovation. And a lot of you
know, we're looking at the

1506
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:13,530
venture model, we're looking at
a lot of different stuff to to

1507
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:18,510
go. And so there will be, you
know, big things in the future

1508
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:21,240
that we're having, but we're not
quite sure. And so right now, if

1509
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,580
you are interested in being part
of that future, we'd love to

1510
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,210
talk to you as an investor or
student or an entrepreneur or

1511
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:31,560
roboticist. But at the at the
moment, we, you know, it's, it's

1512
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:34,110
a giant experiment, even to us,
we got to figure out what will

1513
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:37,830
work and where we can, can
provide value and create the

1514
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:39,330
change that we want to want to
make.

1515
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:43,710
Audrow Nash: Let's see. So if
people are interested, how

1516
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:46,800
should they follow up? Or what
would the what would the good

1517
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:47,370
approach be?

1518
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:50,310
Dan O'Mara: Yeah, if you're
interested in becoming like an

1519
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:54,780
entrepreneur in our in our bay
area, Oakland facility, circuit

1520
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:58,350
launch.com, as we open up other
facilities, hopefully that will

1521
01:30:58,350 --> 01:31:01,560
be, you know, that will also be
the website until we have them.

1522
01:31:01,830 --> 01:31:05,280
Right now. It's just the Oakland
facility. And if you are

1523
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,970
interested in learning, learning
robotics, or you know, building

1524
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:13,920
some of these cool things, mech
labs.ai is the best way to come

1525
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,580
and, and find us and get in
contact, see what what projects

1526
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:21,150
are there and, and build. We've
got some some really fun stuff

1527
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:23,850
up on the on the horizon.

1528
