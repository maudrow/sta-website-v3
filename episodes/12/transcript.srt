00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,460
Audrow Nash: This is a
conversation with Matt Robinson,

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,090
who is a program manager for
ROS industrial Americas at the

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,960
Southwest Research Institute.
ROS industrial is a group that

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,130
seeks to help industrial users
for example, factories, leverage

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,940
ROS and its ecosystem. ROS
industrial has many parts,

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,560
including a GitHub organization
for code contributions, regional

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,340
consortiums, and a newly
announced working group. In this

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,450
interview, Matt and I talk about
how industry often solves

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,260
problems and how those solutions
can be improved with more modern

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,640
tooling like ROS and get Matt's
background, ROS industrials

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,720
consortium and ROS industrials
new working group. This is the

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,350
sensing X Podcast. I'm Audrow
Nash. Thank you to our founding

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,130
sponsor, Open Robotics. And here
is my conversation with Matt

14
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:59,190
Robinson. Hi, Matt, would you
introduce yourself?

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,620
Matt Robinson: Yes, absolutely.
I'm Matt Robinson. I'm the grace

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,880
industrial America's consortium
program manager based here at

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,290
Southwest Research Institute.

18
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,170
Audrow Nash: Yeah, would you
give me a bit of background on

19
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,670
ROS industrial?

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,680
Matt Robinson: Yeah. So. So ROS
industrial is an open source

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,580
project that seeks to extend
ROS, robot operating system to

22
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,480
industrial uses and applications
in industrial relevant hardware.

23
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,710
Right. So it was it was kind of
conceived around 2011. And then

24
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,490
around 2013, a consortium was
established to kind of help give

25
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,380
guidance to what we should be
working on next.

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,140
Audrow Nash: And can you define
industrial for me? Like what

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,650
does it mean to be like, what
are we targeting Exactly? With

28
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,300
industrial? In this?

29
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,790
Matt Robinson: Yeah, no, that's
a great question. Right. And we

30
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,370
get that a lot, right. So
there's a lot of sometimes

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,480
assumptions, when you tag
something as industrial in the

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,190
context of the ROS industrial
open source project. We are

33
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:17,850
seeking to provide open source
utilities that enable industrial

34
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,000
applications on industrial
relevant hardware. So that's the

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,670
mean, the main components of the
industrial tag, if you will,

36
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,610
right, there's a lot of specific
hardware that shows up in the

37
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,740
automation space, in factories,
and sometimes it's somewhat,

38
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,550
they could have like a bit long
in the tooth, right. I mean,

39
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,460
like, it's very common for
certain industrial industrial

40
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,640
sectors to put hardware that
they expected to be there for

41
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,800
1015 years. And so they're very
proven pipelines to facilitate

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,370
these automated processes that
are somewhat unique, right? So

43
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,880
we want to provide in your
faces, needs to interact and

44
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,830
take advantage of this robust
ecosystem. And so that's where

45
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,940
the extending of ROS into this
industrial space was kind of the

46
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,660
main component. Now that said,
as part of like, kind of like

47
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,400
our overriding themes and
mission is to think about the,

48
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,920
when people hear industrial,
where are they sort of these

49
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,580
things, I think, are they think
of reliability, durability,

50
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,010
quality, right? uptime, things
of that nature? Right? So what

51
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,130
are things we have to do is we
think about the capabilities

52
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,180
that we seek to deliver, and
tools we seek to provide, how do

53
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,970
we how do we realize those sort
of attributes?

54
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,030
Audrow Nash: Very interesting.
So going back a little bit

55
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,710
industrial relevant hardware,
how and you mentioned that it

56
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:51,120
should be around for a long
time, so people can plan to use

57
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,260
it. How do you select your
industrial relevant hardware?

58
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,890
Matt Robinson: Right? That's a
good question, too. Right. So

59
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,680
let's, let's talk about a couple
of examples of what industrial

60
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,920
relevant hardware may be right?
So it's kind of an it can be

61
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,480
somewhat ambiguous. So the
industrial manipulator, right,

62
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,050
so we think about, if you've
seen like the big snapshot of

63
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,750
like a place where they make
cars and have all of the arms

64
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,420
reaching in and there's
sometimes sparks flying if it's

65
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,330
a video, that's sort of the
industrial manipulator of

66
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:25,440
retargeting not like, behind me,
we have a number of these other

67
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,120
types of manipulators as well
that are sort of set up to these

68
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,590
in depending on the application
can work around people. But that

69
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,130
is also a class of industrial
relevant hardware in the context

70
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,690
of the manipulator. But we also
look at things like PLCs, the

71
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,530
programmable logic controller,
you know, provided by companies

72
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:51,210
like Rockwell and Bradley, and
of course, Siemens. And, of

73
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,340
course, looking at like
different like sort of vision

74
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:59,280
tools, both emerging
contemporary 3d cameras, all the

75
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,940
way back to Your traditional 2d
cameras which have been running

76
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,560
in factory lines for like last
30 years. That's sort of the

77
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,610
those are just some examples of
industrial hardware that we seek

78
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,940
to help people be able to bring
and merge with the capabilities

79
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,640
that are kind of coming forward
in the ROS ecosystem.

80
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,720
Audrow Nash: And what was kind
of the problem or something that

81
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:28,530
made it so you or whoever
started off industrial? Like,

82
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,060
why did it? Why did you begin it
what problem kind of led to you

83
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,370
wanting to create this
organization?

84
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,590
Matt Robinson: Right, so, you
know, my view like, and we can

85
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,200
talk a bit about, like the whole
layers and Thrall some

86
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,160
industrial, the ROS industrial
open source project was was

87
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,180
started as inspired by actually
a little bit similar to my

88
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,600
background as well, with the
group here at Southwest Research

89
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,430
Institute, and also deliver
solutions. Now, it's not like a

90
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,940
solution provider integrator in
the traditional sense, being a

91
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,960
not for profit Institute here at
Southwest Research Institute,

92
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,750
but the group here develops like
sort of like unique Hi, Max, one

93
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,820
of a kind, oftentimes, prototype
solutions that live and operate

94
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
in factory environments or field
environments that have been

95
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:26,370
doing so since the early 80s. Up
until or before they adopted

96
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,850
ROS, very often, they would
develop that advanced

97
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,300
application with the industrial
tools that were available at the

98
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,490
time. Right, so the industrial
manipulator and the control

99
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,480
platform that comes with the
Cuca, robot, or fanic, or ABB,

100
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,730
they would develop those
solutions, it gets something

101
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,910
working that does something new
and novel, but lo and behold,

102
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,150
they had to do something
similar. But someone specified a

103
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,660
different mix, if you will, of
the industrial hardware, they

104
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,690
had to basically rewrite the
software from scratch, right,

105
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:03,180
because of the industrial
ecosystem. The the whole stack

106
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,060
from the hardware all the way
back through how you develop

107
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,260
applications for that hardware
operates in a proprietary chain,

108
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:15,630
if you will. And we'll call it a
software stack. Exactly. But but

109
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,780
all those communication, the
middleware, if you will, as well

110
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,480
as like the programming language
and environments, they are all

111
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,310
proprietary to that hardware set
you're selecting. And then even

112
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,310
certain vendors, like would kind
of team up and have better

113
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:34,350
bridges are complementing those
companies. And so yeah, it

114
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,670
wasn't like swappable

115
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:38,249
Audrow Nash: for all these
different. So you'd make a

116
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:40,709
solution. And we'd be like a
mobile base, and then there'd be

117
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:44,189
a robot arm on it. And the
mobile phase and the robot arm,

118
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:48,449
we both have kind of like their
own ways of talking. So it was

119
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:51,989
like a domain specific language
often for using either of those.

120
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:55,169
And then you would have to have
software that is kind of

121
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:58,769
translating between them, so
that you can make them talk and

122
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,329
do some sort of application. Is

123
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,490
Matt Robinson: that correct? Or
you'd have to write in that

124
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,300
specific domain? Sure, right, in
that specific domain. Correct.

125
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,000
And that's usually what
happened. And that's from as

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,040
well, I got very adept at
scripting and, you know, vendor

127
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,920
specific programming languages.
And that's where a lot of us who

128
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,770
were doing, you know,
traditional industrial robot

129
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,700
deployments, dating back to the
early 90s, that's kind of how we

130
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,930
came up. Right. And so, you
know, the challenges is like,

131
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,620
hey, this industrial robotic
solution may offer some

132
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,730
advantages. But it brings with
it different software, different

133
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:40,890
scripting languages, how how you
implement applications, how you

134
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,130
set up communications, you have
to actually factor that if you

135
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,090
were going to actually look at
other other other solutions. And

136
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,110
so obviously, the advent of this
group here in front, Edwards is

137
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,200
in the picture behind me when
they went out to Willow Garage,

138
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,950
and kind of that first discover
motivator about somewhere around

139
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,520
2011, he created that first
interoperability between Boston

140
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,270
and Boston, but there was an
Aha. So hey, I can develop an

141
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,140
advanced application in a sort
of hardware agnostic fashion,

142
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,410
and not have to reinvent all
this stuff. Because I have to do

143
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,570
some other application with a
different hardware stuff like

144
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,790
that in the industrial robotic
space. That was, that was like a

145
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,440
real a huge one.

146
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,370
Audrow Nash: Yeah, yeah. So it
was a reuse. real opportunity.

147
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay.

148
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,950
Matt Robinson: Okay, this is
big,

149
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,780
Audrow Nash: can you speak a bit
more, so it was a big

150
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,220
opportunity, because you could
make it so that instead of using

151
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,790
these domain specific languages
for each hardware component, you

152
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,780
could instead maybe abstract out
that component and then connect

153
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,550
to it with ROS or some other
like, high level thing that you

154
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:56,730
can use as middleware for this.
Okay. And then that gives you

155
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,170
the ability to just worry about
you so you Your interface for

156
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,440
this, whatever the device is,
then you use it in a stack. And

157
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,860
then you can swap it out with
other components. You can swap

158
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,800
new things in, as long as they
have interfaces, you have one

159
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,710
way of talking to them and
controlling them. Right?

160
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,580
Matt Robinson: Yes, that is
obviously the goal. Obviously,

161
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,180
the devils in the details,
always. But But yes, exactly

162
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,420
right. And that was definitely
new in industrial circles,

163
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,150
right. And either became very
good at working with like, you

164
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,000
know, a Cuca, oriental scholar
or offenen,

165
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,150
Audrow Nash: and maybe their own
language in a sense, and a lot

166
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,210
of

167
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,050
Matt Robinson: literally right,
in different support. And they

168
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,710
encourage people like when I
came from industry, I mean,

169
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,370
obviously, like, vendor X wanted
us to buy all of their stuff,

170
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,490
including their software
programming environments, they

171
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:54,090
were incentivized to not foster
interoperability at the time. So

172
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,970
fortunately, like, right, this
notion of abstraction, which is

173
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,020
obviously very common in the
software world, was sort of not

174
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,710
a new concept to develop
industrial applications.

175
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,240
Audrow Nash: Now, going back a
little bit, I would love to hear

176
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,180
about your background, and kind
of how you got started with all

177
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,750
of us.

178
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,520
Matt Robinson: You've Right,
right. So to catch up for the

179
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,830
listeners, right, I have to
confess that I'm not a software

180
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,330
developer, right. So I came out
of like, sort of like materials,

181
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,960
joining materials, research,
welding materials and metals,

182
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:37,920
domain. In caught on with
Caterpillar, the, the heavy

183
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,390
industry equipment producer, and
engine manufacturer, I worked in

184
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,050
our corporate research group,
and quickly got into developing

185
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,500
the applications on robots,
largely focusing in the early

186
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,210
phases on specifically welding.
Some of it pretty complex

187
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,030
welding operations, were trying
to control different things to

188
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:02,400
realize very specific outcomes.
And we had a lot of success in

189
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,820
developing applications, you
know, we had these this robot,

190
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,250
right, and it was all set up and
had all these extra bells and

191
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,670
whistles. And we get something
working really great. Like,

192
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,990
okay, take that and go around
the world and make it work. And

193
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,070
then very quickly, we learned,

194
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,110
Audrow Nash: what do you mean,
take that and go around the

195
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,530
world and make it work? So like,
deploy that scale? Or what do

196
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:22,860
you mean,

197
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:26,160
Matt Robinson: but it scales
relative for a caterpillar is

198
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,620
not a, you know, not a Ford or
GM, right. And so it'd be like,

199
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,650
you know, they may make, you
know, a given product, like a

200
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,160
wheel loader, they may make it
in five or six places. And the

201
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,260
robots may be like, maybe three
or four per site. Because you're

202
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,420
only because you're not making
as many wheel loaders as you're

203
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:51,150
like, you know, border states.
So, you know, not enough, not

204
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,080
enough, let's say buying power
to really put pressure on OEMs

205
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,270
to play nice, not enough buying
power to justify buying an exact

206
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,560
same piece of equipment and
shipping it around the world. So

207
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,310
what would happen is

208
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,190
Audrow Nash: like this lighter
spot, of where you're not able

209
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,620
to scale incredibly effectively,
because you don't have all the

210
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,860
factories lined up for it. So it
was fairly custom solutions. But

211
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,420
it's also big enough that you
want to deploy it 20 times or I

212
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,030
don't know, some some larger
number of times where it has to

213
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,020
be you like all the all the bugs
will come out. And it will be

214
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,930
unreliable unless you kind of
work it out. Well,

215
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,740
Matt Robinson: yeah, I, you
know, if we scale back to just

216
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:37,680
sort of a very manufacturing
benefit, in particular for

217
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,780
dealing with something that has
to do meaningful work in the

218
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,140
field, right. So like, we alert,
right, it's got to lift heavy

219
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,340
stuff. There's a tangible
benefit if I can use robots to

220
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:55,020
make it because the consistent
quality actually leads to a

221
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,410
better performing product that I
can sell to people, right, it

222
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:03,960
lifts more, it weighs less. So
it consumes less gas, or diesel

223
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,400
in the case of big equipment.
And so there's a real incentive

224
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,310
as a real marketing improved
product, I can go out there and

225
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,460
sell if I can leverage
automation to produce it. Now

226
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,250
the challenge was because we
weren't we're not you know, that

227
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,830
particular group I was working
with was not, you know, they

228
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,310
can't buy 1000s of robots,
right? GM has a real benefit

229
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,590
when they work with industrial
robot providers, because they

230
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,560
buy so many, they can make a lot
of, you know, dictate some

231
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,010
rules.

232
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,770
Audrow Nash: They say I want to
do custom thing that's going to

233
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,680
be a bunch of additional work.
And because of the scale of it,

234
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,190
the people making the robots are
like, Okay, we'll do that. That

235
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:38,760
sounds good to us.

236
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,960
Matt Robinson: Yeah. And I felt
like obviously, obviously, there

237
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,870
was a lot of other folks, if you
will, in the same boat that I

238
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,020
was, right where, hey, these
different sites that could

239
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,530
justify buying automation, but
when it came that they couldn't

240
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,260
necessarily buy exactly the same
thing due to support like they

241
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,150
would buy different brands
because that's what was

242
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,350
available and how

243
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,020
Audrow Nash: I could see why
this was so funny. because if

244
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,840
you're by different parts,
because different brands are

245
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,360
available in different regions,
now you have to hook up to that

246
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,390
domain specific thing. And
really quick.

247
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,820
Matt Robinson: Yeah, we had an
application running really well

248
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,840
on a nice orange robot with this
right sensor located on a

249
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,450
totally different mix of
hardware. And we literally

250
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:23,940
showed up, I showed up in, you
know, this other location and

251
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,570
had to start from scratch. My,
my, my one week trip turned into

252
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:33,420
like a month. So that that ended
up being one of the real resume

253
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,050
business cases to when I was at
Caterpillar to get involved with

254
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,770
the ROS industrial open source
projects. Well, I learned that

255
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:44,520
aerospace companies, other heavy
equipment, manufacturers, oil

256
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,930
and gas companies, you know,
ticking through a few even even

257
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,870
tier one automotive, right?
Because they have a slightly

258
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,030
different problem than say your
GM example.

259
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,280
Audrow Nash: We're here wanna
automotive? Is that like, the

260
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,430
really big car companies? Or I
don't know what their

261
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,550
Matt Robinson: tier one
whatever, there's automotive or,

262
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,530
or any letters? Is anyone who
provides the parts to the OEM or

263
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:07,920
the person?

264
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,620
Audrow Nash: Okay, and OEM is
original equipment

265
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,060
manufacturing, manufacturing.

266
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:17,010
Matt Robinson: So GM, yep.
Right? GM, you know, they make

267
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,730
the car, they're the OEM and a
company that's providing them

268
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,890
like, say, the seats or the
dashboard, assembly would be a

269
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:23,220
two.

270
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,180
Audrow Nash: Okay, so the parts
that go into the final product,

271
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,510
that's the tier one, so it keeps
going back. So tier two is the

272
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,900
ones that provide the parts to
tier one. Is it correct?

273
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:37,289
Matt Robinson: Okay, like,
right. Now we're getting into

274
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:40,079
supply chain, which is very
resident in the pandemic era.

275
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:46,769
Right? Yeah. So, but, uh, but
but, uh, sorry, one of my

276
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:51,839
speakers went out. But, but
yeah, so So we ended up learning

277
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,769
that a lot of other producers,
manufacturers, people interested

278
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:58,319
in adopting the benefits of
robotics ran on the same

279
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:01,289
challenges. And that was really
insightful. And all of a sudden,

280
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:02,909
we're starting to build this
little industrial community,

281
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,150
Audrow Nash: it's like, the
challenge was explicitly that

282
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:11,460
most things were not able to
talk well to each other because

283
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,510
of domain specific languages or
like custom hardware setup. So

284
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,020
it was like, they were very
reliable industrial devices, but

285
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,900
they didn't play nice with other
things. So developing kind of

286
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,500
like custom automation
solutions, were a was an

287
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,190
extremely difficult task,
because of this, the domain

288
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,020
specific languages that they
were

289
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,690
Matt Robinson: enrolled in. And
I was, I would say, that was

290
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,700
obviously very prescient, in
your face a big challenge. But

291
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,170
obviously, it also drove a lot
of like, limited ability for

292
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:47,940
reuse, you know, drove, so a lot
of like, you know, hey, we'd

293
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,090
fund some research in a
university, and we can maybe get

294
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,850
it to a point solution, but we
couldn't really leverage it

295
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,900
properly. Yeah. So, you know, we
ended up learning a lot of this

296
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,890
other sort of, you know, when
you go back and look at, you

297
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,960
know, how a lot of software
companies have evolved over the

298
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,570
years, the presence of open
source, how it's able to be

299
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,120
leveraged? What do we talk
about? What do we mean by pre

300
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,780
competitive IP, like all this
was sort of new in some of the

301
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,530
industrial circles, at least
that I ran in? Before, before I

302
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:20,760
got involved with the details
with less industrial, and

303
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,190
learning that a lot of other
manufacturers had these same

304
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,220
challenges. It was a learning
experience.

305
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,970
Audrow Nash: Okay, and then so
you were at Caterpillar? Where

306
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,640
did you go from? So you and then
you were building these kind of

307
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,780
custom solutions for doing some
sort of automation task that

308
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:42,450
would improve a fairly small
man, like you're making only? I

309
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,780
don't know the numbers, but you
had like 20 robots making them

310
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,540
or something, some product, but
a wheel loader, or whatever you

311
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,110
have mentioned? Yeah. Where do
you go from there?

312
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,810
Matt Robinson: So, you know,
like I said, I worked in

313
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,110
corporate research in we had a
little automation team. And so

314
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,810
we started basically
collaborating with the team here

315
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,800
at Southwest Research Institute
to identify some potential near

316
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,000
term use cases or business cases
around like, what what does ROS

317
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,860
really offer us? Right? Okay.

318
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,980
Audrow Nash: So at this time,
you had been exposed to ROS or

319
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,660
like, how did ROS come into the
picture?

320
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:21,630
Matt Robinson: We ran into the
ROS industrial team at a

321
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:26,670
conference. Okay? And ask them
we're like, Hey, what is this?

322
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,510
Tell us about it? And my
predecessor, Paul Voss, and

323
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,760
Shaun Edwards, again, pictured
over my shoulder for those

324
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,690
watching the video. Their boss,
Paul Evans, they came out to

325
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,230
caterpillar and explained it to
us, right, and then we found a

326
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,540
way to kind of get involved and
hence there was already this

327
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,860
consortium established. And as
Caterpillar, we join that

328
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,760
consortium, right, so I was kind
of the caterpillar face for the

329
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,970
ROS industrial consortium. And
I started like, kind of

330
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,500
collaborating and sharing core
stories with other members. But

331
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,830
then how do we move the ball
forward? leveraging open source

332
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,710
and is this is this something we
can really do in an industrial

333
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,920
setting? That was still a
question. Back in like,

334
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,450
20 2015 2014? Wow, I can't be
like why we actually saw can we

335
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,880
solve industrial problems with
with ROS?

336
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:20,220
Audrow Nash: Source? Yeah, yeah.
And what did to? And then how

337
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,290
did that investigating that
question go?

338
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,180
Matt Robinson: Great, right. So
obviously, we got involved. The

339
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,520
consortium has a bunch of other
similar minded folks with

340
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,840
similar challenges. You know,
and it's not relevant. It's not

341
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,150
narrow to like, say,
construction equipment or

342
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,570
whatever, I rattle off a couple
of other industries, the Boeing,

343
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,100
Boeing's and others, there was a
documentary for our BMW not long

344
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,930
ago. And so, you know, we got
involved with a couple different

345
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,840
pilot initiatives to kind of see
if we could prove like, hey,

346
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,770
what can we do? You know, to
that point, everything we did

347
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:59,880
was very, you know, I grabbed up
the user interface, the Teach

348
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,660
pendant on the robot, and I, you
know, programmed it, I could

349
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,780
script it on my computer and
then loaded onto the robot. But

350
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,150
I was still really, I'd still
have to go through and tweak all

351
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,030
those positions, like, right,
you try their interface

352
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,510
Audrow Nash: for how to do it.
Yeah. Right. So I've heard I've

353
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,820
heard some horror stories about
that. But I don't know that I

354
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,930
really. So that's crazy. You
would like it's like this big

355
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,000
tablet? And you would like,
would it be like a block

356
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,850
programming kind of thing on
some interface that the company

357
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,510
may? Or?

358
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,790
Matt Robinson: It's it's
scripting? Yeah, it's a

359
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:35,460
scripting language. And, and
this would be like, if I was

360
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,230
more prepared, I would have
probably wheeled over one of

361
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:43,350
these robots who could have done
it live. But but but no, it was

362
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,020
very laborious. And they were
introducing things like offline

363
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,690
programming, but it was really
just sitting at your desk or

364
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:55,080
doing it on a computer. Lab and
or on the shop floor?

365
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,290
Audrow Nash: Oh, yeah. Cuz you
couldn't see what I was doing.

366
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,780
You could just write the bulk of
it from your computer.

367
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,090
Matt Robinson: Yeah. And you
might have like, a visualization

368
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,620
perfectly matches the physical
system. Right. So that's why

369
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,290
when we talk about the utilities
that for industrial use cases,

370
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:14,070
one of the ones is all the stuff
around calibration. And so we

371
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,530
ran some pilot programs during
my time at Caterpillar and was

372
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:21,180
like, Oh, wow, like, I could
really not do this traditional

373
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,430
industrial robot programming
with this teaching with the

374
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:29,880
Teach pendant or whatever, at an
offline. You know, hey, we can

375
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,650
basically do this notion of
like, you know, use perception

376
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,730
perceive things, leverage the
data streams to make decisions,

377
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,000
do motion planning, and actually
execute processes that was mind

378
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,140
blowing at the time, like in
this 2013 2014 timeframe. And so

379
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,800
we ran a couple pilot projects
in parallel, like we'd already

380
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,190
been doing work and perception,
like, hey, wow, 3d cameras, this

381
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,870
is this is really useful. And
notions of segmentation, right?

382
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:05,700
Like, oh, work on this and not
that. In so we've been doing

383
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,160
work with universities in that
space. But again, it was really

384
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,130
hard to scale. So bringing
generalize it

385
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,200
Audrow Nash: and yeah, you said
it was like a point solution. So

386
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,230
it's solving one specific
problem, but not, it doesn't

387
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,540
generalize to other problems
very easily.

388
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,510
Matt Robinson: Okay, we're x. So
we started getting into like,

389
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,620
what they called at the time,
this focus technical project,

390
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,660
which are these collaborative
projects in the ROS industrial

391
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,690
Consortium on blending, and
blending is this notion of

392
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,140
getting some sanding media. If
you think about your, your wood

393
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,960
furniture at home, like you're
going to refinish it, you want

394
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,270
to blend all those surfaces
together, right? So you can

395
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,520
repaint it, right. That's
basically what we're doing with

396
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,300
metal parts, we perceive them.
If it's a flat surface, I apply

397
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,540
some raster patterns. And then
you can sit there and visualize

398
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,960
the motion plan. And yeah, that
looks reasonable go never got

399
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,470
it. No teach pendant
programming. I don't necessarily

400
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:00,330
like drawing stuff on CAD files,
which you know, doesn't

401
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,380
necessarily save you time. Those
are very legal demonstrations of

402
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,810
proof of proof of concepts were
able to do it Caterpillar they

403
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:10,950
got really good by. That's
awesome. Then from from there

404
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,400
and continue to grow. This
notion of collaborative projects

405
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,700
and things like that. And so
now, a handful of years later, I

406
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,000
had the opportunity to kind of,
you know, streaking it up to the

407
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,850
open source Kool Aid and this
idea of leveraging ROS 2 solve

408
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,000
industrial problems. I had a
chance to come here and take

409
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,630
over the ROS industrial project
here from my predecessor, Paul

410
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,370
Voss, and I did that in 2017.

411
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:36,839
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. And how
does it actually so one thing is

412
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:41,819
when you're saying, like
collaborative work on these, you

413
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:45,239
mean basically using something
like I don't know, some version

414
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:48,899
control like Git or something so
that programmers can work on it

415
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:52,649
at the at different times in
different places and kind of all

416
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:56,909
collaborate towards one product.
Yes. Is this what you mean? Oh,

417
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,000
Matt Robinson: my God, like back
then, like in our life.

418
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,530
Manufacturing Research that was
all very new, like get get what?

419
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:10,290
Like right? At the time like,
right so that that idea of

420
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:14,370
collaborating on software from
different locations, we did that

421
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,640
collaborative project and the
ROS industrial sort of family,

422
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,260
if you will, the consortium we
partnered with Boeing was a

423
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,700
performer on that particular
project, as well as wolf

424
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,510
robotics was like the solution
provider out of Fort Collins,

425
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,090
they're now part of Lincoln
Electric, and of course, as

426
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,390
Caterpillar, and we offer like
little in kind contributions,

427
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,060
like we developed our team
developed a key driver for this

428
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:43,680
laser line scanner. But yeah,
but to your point, right, there

429
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,490
was the first time that we had
to script up stuff, put it

430
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,240
someplace where other people can
merge it in. And, and that sort

431
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,920
of workflow. workflow is very
new to a group that was very

432
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,010
used to like, I'm developing
right on the robot controller,

433
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:01,920
right? I'm not, I'm not putting
it someplace where it's really,

434
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,390
truly accessible by others. And
can be like, you know, you know,

435
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:11,550
it could be reviewed version of,
of that Git workflow, if you

436
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:16,470
will. And that's, that's been a
slow process, we still work with

437
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:20,010
traditional industrial
stakeholders that are still

438
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:24,630
getting up to speed on that kind
of get workflow. And that's been

439
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,680
that's been a fun ride. As we
talk about software and

440
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,990
industrial settings, obviously,
here in early 2020s. I mean,

441
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,900
right, between the startup
communities and the prevalence

442
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,390
or emergence of ROS and people
looking at industrial

443
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,180
applications, it's becoming more
commonplace. But like, in the

444
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:46,200
early 2010s, it was non
existent, almost. We had to

445
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,080
figure out what GitHub was
right? We have to get permission

446
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:55,320
to use it. Yeah, right. Because
the IRS corporate IT groups are

447
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:55,830
like, Oh, the

448
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,770
Audrow Nash: internet? Yeah, the
internet's bad. Yeah, you're

449
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:04,230
putting your stuff on there.
Yeah. It's kind of I mean, so I

450
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,140
guess I have most of my
background is in software, I

451
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:12,240
would say. And it is shocking to
me to hear that it was, it's

452
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,690
like 2010 10 years ago, ish.
That, like these kind of things

453
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:22,380
that I associate, as modern
workflows are not being used.

454
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,980
But that's very interesting. And
so the pipeline, but how it

455
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,000
typically worked, it was you
have several people that are

456
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,690
working on different things, and
you modularize the problem, so

457
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:38,130
that each person can do or we,
each entity can work on one

458
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,860
thing and have that one thing,
do it very well. And then you

459
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,760
just combine them and in theory,
it works perfectly. Is that is

460
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,610
that kind of like the
traditional way of doing things?

461
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,909
Matt Robinson: That's probably
Yeah, so you'd have the person

462
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:54,059
who's doing like the robot
programming, you'd have a person

463
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:56,819
who's doing like, let's say,
there's some sensor on the robot

464
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:59,729
that's gonna do some thinking or
processing a lot, the one person

465
00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:03,839
who sets that up and programs
it. And then you have like, say,

466
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,859
an electrical engineer who who
slash controls person who might

467
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:12,089
do your PLC and control like
electrical panel, and then yes,

468
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:15,209
and then there's an integration
sort of period of time, where

469
00:28:15,209 --> 00:28:17,129
all three of them will come
together and try to like, make

470
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:20,549
sure all their stuffs
communicating properly. That's,

471
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:23,549
that's actually, in some
regards, still a similar

472
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:26,219
workflow that we use here. And
we do advanced systems as we

473
00:28:26,219 --> 00:28:29,999
bolted on also the software
development piece, right, which,

474
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:33,089
which enables us to kind of at
least addressed interfaces, we

475
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:36,659
can test a lot of the interfaces
and message passing, you know,

476
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:39,989
in simulation, we have a few
more tools at our disposal than

477
00:28:39,989 --> 00:28:44,699
we had 10 years ago. And
obviously, even though here,

478
00:28:44,699 --> 00:28:49,649
we're advanced, say compared to
traditional manufacturers, you

479
00:28:49,649 --> 00:28:52,259
know, we still have to overcome
some of the limitations of the

480
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:55,829
industrial hardware, what it
will just support, right, like,

481
00:28:56,189 --> 00:29:00,989
every every everyone, like no
one has like it, this notion of

482
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:06,299
a documented API. Not nice.
Right?

483
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,750
Audrow Nash: So there's no
application programmer interface

484
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,320
to, like use the things kind of
clearly.

485
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,300
Matt Robinson: Yeah, I mean,
well, because again, we're going

486
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,270
their scripting language, maybe
exactly, just did not stay in

487
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:21,960
our ecosystem,

488
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,930
Audrow Nash: right. That's kind
of in our ecosystem. And that's

489
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,290
kind of

490
00:29:25,949 --> 00:29:30,209
Matt Robinson: a mantra, if you
will, right. So but that's, it's

491
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:33,269
making progress, right? Like,
you know, we were at a

492
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:36,509
conference one time, and this
guy stood up and raised his

493
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:40,439
hand, and he's lying. There was
this time, I downloaded

494
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:43,319
Solitaire and my computer got a
virus. And now you're telling us

495
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:45,479
to download download software
off the internet and run our

496
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:51,629
robots with it. And so that's
where we were starting. The

497
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:55,589
industrial sector is, I mean,
they've been they've been doing

498
00:29:55,589 --> 00:30:00,719
what they do for an automation
for 50 6070 years and so cases

499
00:30:01,229 --> 00:30:05,249
PLCs been around a long, long
time. So it's right it was a

500
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:08,789
real disruption to think about,
you know, over and over again,

501
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:13,169
some open source pieces layer on
kind of just like the stuff of

502
00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:16,439
novel stuff to do this specific
thing. But then like not

503
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,229
reinvent the wheel. And like,
Hey, we're gonna maintain it and

504
00:30:19,229 --> 00:30:21,629
make contributions back to the
stuff in the open source.

505
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:24,749
Because right rising tide lifts
all boats. And there are some

506
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:26,819
people that are just like, Wait,
you're going to download stuff

507
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:30,449
off the internet and run an
industrial robot. I mean, we, it

508
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:36,869
took a long time to just define
open source get a consensus of

509
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:40,349
understanding in the industrial
community. And it was funny, I

510
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:44,669
sat with a peer in Germany, he's
like, You know what? Like, the

511
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:48,269
whole, like, you can put open
source on an industrial piece of

512
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:50,369
equipment and have it do
something meaningful in a

513
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:54,209
factory and the whole place not
melt or break down. We want

514
00:30:54,209 --> 00:30:57,209
that, like, we're doing that.
And we are and lots of people,

515
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:00,179
lots of great startups over the
years, was it there's that one

516
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:03,509
article, like 80% of new
startups, whatever the robot

517
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:05,969
they're putting out there. Like
there's, there's ROS, there's a

518
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:07,709
ROS something on Yeah, it's

519
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,480
Audrow Nash: crazy. I don't know
the number either, but it's

520
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,790
quite high, which is nuts. And
it's

521
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:14,130
Matt Robinson: great, right? And
that and that. And that was if

522
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:18,030
we didn't done nothing else, we
brought the industrial sector to

523
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:22,200
the party, right, and generated
some general acceptance for open

524
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,740
source and like, Hey, you can do
this, right. And this can work.

525
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,560
And that's, that's been fun.
It's been great to see that

526
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,160
change over time, compared to
where we were, we were like in

527
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,720
the early teens, 20 times.

528
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,170
Audrow Nash: Yeah, I imagine
it's pretty exciting to see kind

529
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,290
of it coming along in this. And
you can probably move a good bit

530
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:44,010
faster when you adopt some of
these kind of these different

531
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,910
development paradigms like
version control, and you can

532
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,160
collaborate and then you can tie
it with simulation, and you have

533
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,580
all the parts integrated. So you
can test them all together. Even

534
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,910
if it is limited in like, say a
simulation or something, but you

535
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:00,600
still don't it's not like this
one part. We're only going to

536
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,540
test that. And then we're going
to connect it to something

537
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:07,710
that's also only tested by
itself. Whereas you can like say

538
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:11,370
all of these things are in the
the gazebo simulator, and we're

539
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:15,120
just going to run this control
code on it and see if it does

540
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,590
what we intended to do.

541
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,700
Matt Robinson: That's quite
nice. Okay, so going back.

542
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:28,860
Audrow Nash: So you were at
Caterpillar? Now, did you go?

543
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,540
How did you end up at?

544
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:36,600
Matt Robinson: Southwest
Research Institute? Yeah, so you

545
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,460
know, I've been doing my job at
Caterpillar, like 10% Was this

546
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:46,020
open source? You know, motion
planning, you know, no more

547
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,560
teach better programming robot
stuff. Like that was like, Okay.

548
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,450
And that was the funnest part of
my job, right? And I had all

549
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:55,830
this other stuff. And I was
like, I was kind of like, yeah,

550
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,050
looking at different
opportunities, right. So I mix

551
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:03,690
it up. And the guys here heard,
and they're like, Hey, why don't

552
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,300
you come down here? And like,
you know, I'm like, oh, like,

553
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,090
run the ROS Industrial Program.
Like, you got to be kidding me.

554
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,180
I don't know anything about this
stuff, right? I'm just some guy,

555
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,720
like running some projects. Now.
Like, no, no, you have that

556
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:21,510
perspective of the person who
hates programming. Okay, I

557
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:26,160
definitely have plenty of that.
And so, so yeah, I, we talked,

558
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,730
and they found a role for me.
And I was like, alright, we'll

559
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:35,010
give it a shot. And so I came
down and middle of 2017. And

560
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,730
obviously, I brought a little
different perspective, right? I

561
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:43,950
mean, you know, I, I was putting
robots on the factory floor and

562
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,950
commissioning them and, and then
like, trying to replicate

563
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:50,430
successes on on certain hardware
or development configurations,

564
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:54,330
and trying to replicate that and
really struggling. So I brought

565
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,970
that in. So when other people
had that pain, I was like, oh,

566
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,940
yeah, we had that pain, too. And
then like, obviously, I come

567
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,570
from a pure group where, you
know, when someone brings up a

568
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,450
terminals, and they're like,
bouncing between the terminals,

569
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,200
I'm like, yeah, like people in
the industry community can't do

570
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,970
that now. Right? Because we're
not software developers. Right?

571
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,270
So there was this idea of like,
what can we do to to lower the

572
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:21,720
barrier to entry? And obviously,
we've seen a lot of progress on

573
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,700
that front, right between nice
IDE ease between, you know,

574
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,550
other, like just more Python,
right, lowers the barrier to

575
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:35,820
entry. You know, there wasn't a
ton of Python stuff. When we

576
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,600
first started poking around, but
all of that helps, right? And so

577
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,900
that the whole lower the barrier
to entry is obviously, part of

578
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,860
our mission is

579
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:50,910
Audrow Nash: just, I'm sure
people know, mostly but so IDE

580
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:54,690
is integrated development
environment. And so that's like

581
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,380
where you code. Often it makes
things a lot easier. If you have

582
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,460
a good IDE And then Python,
maybe I don't need to define it,

583
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,600
but just a programming language,
which, for ROS, we are a lot of

584
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,660
C++, which is low level. And we
have some Python, which is like

585
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,800
a nice scripting language. And
so that's higher level easier,

586
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,360
you can say like print,
quotations Hi, and then close

587
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:24,930
it, and it will print that out.
And so it's like it's easier. So

588
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,500
it makes it nicer for working,
because people can just kind of

589
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,920
see the logic right there. And
it's almost like a human

590
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,650
readable, like, paragraph kind
of thing.

591
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,220
Although it's death,
almost. Okay,

592
00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:40,859
Audrow Nash: so one of the big
parts of ROS industrial, you're

593
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:45,479
saying is lowering that barrier
of entry? How are you doing

594
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:49,709
that? Or like, what are some
strategies you guys are working

595
00:35:49,709 --> 00:35:52,109
towards to try to lower the
barrier of entry?

596
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,650
Matt Robinson: That's a great
question. Right. So obviously,

597
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:59,730
one of the things we do in our
little consortium family is we

598
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,360
provide training, right? And the
training is constantly evolving,

599
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:08,850
based on the feedback from the
membership, right? So they want

600
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,910
to they want more examples, and
helps them there's like, sort of

601
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:16,290
templates to do certain classes
of things. Obviously, we've

602
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:23,220
tried to give an example. Yeah,
maybe, right. But setting up

603
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,310
what a good example is like, we
have a training on setting up a

604
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,310
perception pipeline. Okay,
right. And then we have a

605
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,910
training class, where we
leverage the perception pipeline

606
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,090
to say, like, do a pick and
place down, right, so you

607
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,480
perceive this object, and you
identify and grasp when you go

608
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,300
get it? Right. So we have this
whole lab exercise that takes

609
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,650
place on the top, one of the
pieces of hardware that are

610
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:51,390
behind me. And then, so they get
to like kind of actually build

611
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,990
an application, but they have
some skeleton to start with.

612
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,230
Right? We went through an
example, right, which can become

613
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,220
sort of the template.

614
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,800
Audrow Nash: Yeah, that's how we
can work with some something

615
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,270
that kind of already works

616
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,250
Matt Robinson: correctly,
obviously, like, sometimes the

617
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,680
feedback is, well, this is a lot
of copy and paste. I don't know

618
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,220
what I'm copying and pasting.
But so it's a continuous

619
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,400
journey. And that, but that
feedback only makes it better.

620
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:19,260
But obviously, you know, the
more you know, obviously, the

621
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:24,360
issue is, you know, I mean, the
tech world is rapidly evolving

622
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,990
all the time. So new things are
always coming out. And of

623
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:32,670
course, what legs is the
documentation that we're in the

624
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,730
same boat where where we've been
doing a lot of interesting new

625
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:40,050
work and in reconstruction and
different types of motion

626
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,240
planners, we have an
optimization based motion

627
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,710
planning framework that's out
there. So

628
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,850
Audrow Nash: are you for all
these things? are you leveraging

629
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:51,060
things that are in Rosu? For
your navigation? Are you using

630
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,510
like nav two, for your motion
planning are using like move it?

631
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,570
Or is it kind of custom
solutions for industry things?

632
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,560
Matt Robinson: So where we want
to, we want to stick with, with

633
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,130
what's out there, emerging out
of the community, right? We

634
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,160
really want it's extending ROS
into industrial applications. So

635
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,740
creating like homegrown stuff
kind of defeats the purpose.

636
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,210
Now, obviously, there are cases
where something special needs to

637
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:20,190
emerge. And thereby, you will
create that, in a lot of cases,

638
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,850
we open sourced. Right, so one
great example that comes up in

639
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,990
our community is the emergence
of Tesseract, which is motion

640
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,920
planning environments very
similar to move it, it was born

641
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,240
out of a very specific use case.
And it was chosen to open source

642
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,030
it, because why not? Right. And
it's still it's still we we

643
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:45,300
leave, all of our training is
still built on move it we start

644
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,960
with movement. But then for
those interested or specific

645
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,780
applications, we have this
alternative called Tesseract

646
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,980
that, in certain situations
offers some benefits. But we

647
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,700
don't necessarily offer like,
say training on it. It's sort of

648
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,490
like, if your application sort
of would benefit from some of

649
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:06,030
the things here, you know, we
can do some use on demand,

650
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,030
right? But But in general, we
start with, to your point,

651
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:13,620
right, the NASDAQ move it and
the tools they're in, we want

652
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,500
people to because the benefit is
the whole benefit of this whole

653
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,220
open source idea is that once we
start using them, we make

654
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,000
contributions back. Right. So if
we made a bunch of replicates of

655
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,580
stuff, well, then we just spread
out the contributions and

656
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:31,110
they're less impactful. Right?
So we want to start in use the

657
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:35,460
most common tools as well. And
so yes, so hence we've migrated

658
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,180
our training over to ROS 2 as
well we're trying to as I

659
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:44,040
described earlier, right the in
the industrial crowd is slow to

660
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,850
move, right because they like
what works. So we've been having

661
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:52,140
to be very judicious and how we
manage rolling out in the

662
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:57,480
direction of ROS 2 but but but
we're getting right. Most

663
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,720
recently we also are trying to
revisit our We're gonna phases

664
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,510
because in the industrial side
that's really lagged. But it's a

665
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,660
good opportunity to revisit for
consistency purposes, you can

666
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,250
talk more about that. Yes, for

667
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,680
Audrow Nash: sure. Yeah, that's
very interesting. I want to talk

668
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,420
about that have you got before
have you is one approach that

669
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:19,860
you guys may do abstracting
things further. So if, say, I

670
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:23,280
want to move something from here
to here, and from one location

671
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,590
to another, maybe I abstract
what you need to do in that to

672
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:32,820
or subtract what you need to do
and move it or something so that

673
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,080
it's easier at kind of like,
like, instead of like, I'm gonna

674
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:41,340
do all like, I want to run this
specific thing, or this set of

675
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:46,080
commands in NAB to maybe like,
more at a behavioral level or

676
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,600
something like something that's,
that's

677
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,280
Matt Robinson: like, that's
actually it's interesting.

678
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,470
Right? So that's some of the
that sort of like, just kind of

679
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,830
give a higher order kind of
instruction. Yeah, exactly

680
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:02,730
assist or empower the system to
make the optimal decision. Yeah.

681
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,710
Because like, let's say we have
a mobile manipulator to your

682
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,950
right, we're now getting
involved and move it. I don't

683
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:10,830
necessarily want to have to
like, push out commands the

684
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:14,370
boat, right? It needs to be a
higher order. And then let the

685
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:19,080
system's intelligence sort of
figure out a bunch of

686
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,570
Audrow Nash: smart programmers
figure it out once and then

687
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,070
everyone gets to benefit from it

688
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:27,150
Matt Robinson: correct. And we
are we are trying to bring to

689
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,780
some proof of concept
capabilities in that space to

690
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,550
present to like, say the
manufacturing engineer knows

691
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:38,550
process, they know what they
have to do in their factory, but

692
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,080
is it going to, to your point,
command driven or math, right,

693
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,730
they're gonna have to tell it
like, hey, you need to do it

694
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:49,740
like this, just go do that.
Right? When abstract away, if

695
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:54,870
you will, that move that voice
level, but that level. Next

696
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:58,740
level down, we have some proof
of concept initiatives going in

697
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,790
that direction, we have put out
some material on those, and some

698
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:06,630
of the progress we're making. So
for those interested, you know,

699
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,930
if you when you share the
LinkedIn stuff, you'll see posts

700
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,120
about some of the outcomes from
some of those group meetings

701
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,880
that talk about some of the work
going on what we call our

702
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,090
development environments for
industrial applications. And

703
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,520
that's something we're looking
to hopefully find some people to

704
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,060
poke holes at and and try. And
so we're looking for some beta

705
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:28,260
testers now, we're hoping that
help some of our industrial

706
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,110
stakeholders lower the barrier
to and again, that whole idea of

707
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,910
lowering the barrier,
particularly as the systems get

708
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:37,650
more complex, of course, you'll
not just mobile, but we'll do we

709
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:40,320
do a lot with gantry based
systems. And that's where a

710
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,410
manipulator maybe inverted up
that upside down. And it's an a

711
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:47,760
huge gantry that has x, y, z.
And it can take that manipulator

712
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,110
through an entire volume.

713
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:53,010
Audrow Nash: I'm imagining a 3d
printer with an arm instead of

714
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,300
the printing spot.

715
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,880
Matt Robinson: Yeah, absolutely.
Something like that. That's,

716
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:00,540
that's a great example. And so
obviously, of all the redundant

717
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:03,450
axes, there's lots of solutions.
How do you how do you search

718
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,300
that space? Right. And so what
are the tools for that? How do

719
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,890
you prioritize using the axes?
Sorry, gantry axes versus the

720
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:15,270
manipulator axes? I mean, so,
you know, we're trying to bring

721
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:17,100
tools to kind of enable end
users to

722
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,770
Audrow Nash: take advantage of
that thing. That's interesting.

723
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:23,460
I don't I don't know much about
use cases for gantries with the

724
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,070
robotic arms on them or
anything. That seems quite cool.

725
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:33,210
I have you. I don't. I did an
interview earlier with Brett

726
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:37,470
Aldrich. From Smak. Have you
thought of there? Like, have you

727
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:41,760
looked at SMAC for kind of like
a higher level way of

728
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,000
controlling robots for specific
tasks? It kind of seems like

729
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,810
their use case.

730
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:49,260
Matt Robinson: Yeah. So it's
interesting. You mentioned Brett

731
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:55,110
and snack. I had to today's
Friday. So yesterday, I was at a

732
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,850
Technical Steering Committee
meeting and talking about

733
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:01,770
hardware interfaces. And and how
we'd like to do a new reference

734
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:05,970
implementation to kind of herd
the cats on hardware interfaces.

735
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,240
In Brett Pinkney after that
particular meeting, said like,

736
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,790
Hey, we should we should talk
about Smak. I was like, That's a

737
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:15,600
great idea. So other than like
reading, reading, like three

738
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:20,160
lines about it, I have immersed
myself derelict on catching up

739
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,030
on some of my reading. I've only
caught wind of Bratton his work

740
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,630
since he was getting engaged
with the Technical Steering

741
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:27,990
Committee.

742
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,290
Audrow Nash: One of the
community members for sure,

743
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,810
Matt Robinson: correct. Yeah.
And obviously, like when I read

744
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:36,180
his application, I was like,
Yeah, this guy. This guy's

745
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:41,220
awesome. For sure. So we're
excited. And I'm glad he reached

746
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,950
out to me and I look forward to
learning more smack Yeah, it's

747
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:48,450
probably it could be, again
much. You know, we've had folks

748
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:53,400
like Brett, come speak to our
industrial audience. And so that

749
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,700
those opportunities are existing
and we're just trying to I have

750
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,700
a hard time keeping up and I'm
like in the ROS world more than

751
00:44:59,700 --> 00:44:59,970
I thought

752
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,300
Audrow Nash: my demo directions
in less

753
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,420
Matt Robinson: so right. So
where it makes sense. I tried

754
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,410
to, in some of our organizations
though, like stodgy or right

755
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:13,890
kind of old school, they do have
people that really are looking

756
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:17,940
for solutions. And like to hear
from these types of people,

757
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,390
right, so we try to we do a lot
of that matchmaking. Obviously,

758
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,040
if there's a chance to
collaborate with you, we'd love

759
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:23,490
to see them.

760
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:27,780
Audrow Nash: Awesome. Yeah, if
you maybe some help with the

761
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,670
background, but if you're
speaking with him anyway,

762
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:34,020
there's a previous podcast
interview with where we went

763
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:38,130
into like, pretty deep detail on
how SMAC works and where it

764
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:44,670
might be useful. But so now
you're at Southwest at the

765
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:50,610
Southwest Research Institute,
sweary. And you're leading ROS

766
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:53,790
industrial from there, and you
have a bunch of projects and a

767
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:57,270
team, or what's the setup? And
how does it work? And how does

768
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:58,410
the organization

769
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:01,080
Matt Robinson: for great, great,
right, so we have this

770
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,770
manufacturing robotics
department, here at the

771
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:08,070
Institute. And they leverage all
these tools in their day to day

772
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:11,640
problem solving. Right? So
they're kind of like, the ROS

773
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,580
industrial developing team, if
you will, are contributors. So

774
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,680
the rest of us are open source
project, but their users as

775
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,580
well. And we try to walk the
talk, right? So we take all

776
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:25,470
these things, and we go solve
problems with that. Now, how

777
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:25,890
large

778
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:28,049
Audrow Nash: is the business
model? And is it tied to a

779
00:46:28,049 --> 00:46:30,869
company and a bunch of things
like this, they don't quite

780
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:31,679
understand.

781
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,460
Matt Robinson: Essential,
essentially, the Institute at a

782
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,390
high level, right, which has
about 11 operation operating

783
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:43,590
divisions. One of the most well
known is the Space Science

784
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,560
Division, right? Because they
actually have a mission control

785
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,660
here and lead missions for NASA.
There was a couple different the

786
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,720
New Horizons was one where they
kind of went by and did some

787
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,610
shots of Pluto. Space Science,
and then here in our division,

788
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:02,250
right, so I'm in a department or
division is three of us what

789
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:05,580
unmanned ground systems are
applied sensing. And then

790
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,720
critical systems does a lot of
NASA software. And of course, we

791
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,750
collaborate with them as well to
share tips and practices and

792
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:16,710
where ROS makes sense. But
anyways, so there's, it's all

793
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:21,180
applied engineering contract
r&d. Actually, when I was at

794
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,830
Caterpillar, we spent a lot of
time here doing dyno testing.

795
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,890
Right, so about half of
caterpillars dyno testing occurs

796
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:31,380
here at Southwest Research
Institute. It's totally vital.

797
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,580
Sorry, yeah. So it's really
taking the engine. And they

798
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:39,390
basically try to run it, like so
they put all these they feel

799
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,880
they pump fuel into it and make
sure the exhaust is handled

800
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,460
effectively. But it just sits
there on a stand and runs, they

801
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,040
put it through its paces, they
may, they may make the room,

802
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,810
they may make the room very
cold, and they make

803
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,910
Audrow Nash: very hot so they
can test all the different

804
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,010
conditions while running. I see

805
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,870
Matt Robinson: my anywhere.
Correct, I was supporting on

806
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:02,160
Highway tear three emissions at
the time for modeling trucks.

807
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:05,820
Tier three was at the time they
were trying to address diesel

808
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:11,220
particulates. So I was the
materials person involved with a

809
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,040
lot of the creation of some of
the components for the that

810
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,950
particular exhaust system at the
time. And so they were running a

811
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:20,760
lot of those tests here. So but
it's but it's multi discipline,

812
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,130
right? So I mentioned space
science, obviously, we're

813
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:27,570
manufacturing robotics, we have
unmanned ground systems. So we

814
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:31,860
have all these different groups.
And so

815
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,750
Audrow Nash: an effective thing
around these. Yeah, you have

816
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:39,840
like, cuz i You say different
domains, but I assume it's like,

817
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,760
fairly similar competencies
between the different domains or

818
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,560
at least complementary in some
sense.

819
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:50,610
Matt Robinson: Yeah. So you
know, I mean, you're there's a

820
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:54,720
lot of computer science across
the Institute, a lot of material

821
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,030
science folks like myself,
mostly in the mechanical

822
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:02,460
engineering division. A lot of
mechanical engineers, a lot of

823
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:07,440
chemists, we have a whole
chemistry, division as well. So

824
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:10,380
so but we basically think back
to my group at Caterpillar, I

825
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:14,250
worked at corporate research.
This group had unique skills

826
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,130
that I didn't have software
skills in my Manufacturing

827
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,800
Research Group, explicitly, I
had some people could do some

828
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,580
Python. So we would work with
this team, we'd write a little

829
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,780
contract, then they worked as
like an extension, corporate r&d

830
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,920
team. I had worked to some
statement of work and help my

831
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,880
team out. And in very much like
I like to describe it, we work

832
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,870
with somebody, we want to lead
them, not just with something we

833
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:43,380
give them, but their staff is a
little bit better using the

834
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,480
tools than they were before we
show them. Right. So we don't

835
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,780
just deliver them something we
teach them while we work with

836
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,980
them as part of the delivery to
teach them as ons. Yeah, I mean,

837
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,860
here we are using all these open
source tools we want. We don't

838
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:59,310
want to just give you a software
that we will but ideally you

839
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:02,430
have someone in your team You
can learn it as well and be self

840
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:05,820
sufficient. So you don't
necessarily have to us. Oh,

841
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,890
definitely, that's that's sort
of the model here and

842
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,550
proliferates around the
institute. Right? The whole

843
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:15,120
there's a tagline about
benefiting science in humanity.

844
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,750
So we try to walk that talk,
right? We try to help our

845
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:22,590
partners teach our partners, as
well as like deliver novel

846
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:26,190
solutions. The cool thing about
unique about our department

847
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,970
specifically, and our division
is we don't just deliver the

848
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:32,400
novel solution, but we also try
to make contributions or offer

849
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,370
things in the open source. So
hence, a lot of the robot

850
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:39,510
drivers, some of the calibration
utilities, they they're born out

851
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:42,540
of this group, specifically, as
well as some of our partner

852
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:46,890
groups. ROS industrial is
stewarded by three organizations

853
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:49,200
you've mentioned Southwest
Research Institute, but I'd be

854
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,460
remiss not to mention Fraunhofer
IPA in Stuttgart, Germany and

855
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:56,400
the advanced remanufacturing
Technology Center in Singapore,

856
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,400
Stuart ROS, industrial Europe
and ROS industrial Asia

857
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,630
Pacific, respectively. Those
organizations also make great

858
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:07,590
contributions to open source and
of course, ROS ROS, too, and

859
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,310
ROS industrial.

860
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:12,720
Audrow Nash: Can you tell me a
bit about the consortium? Around

861
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,680
ROS industrial?

862
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,780
Matt Robinson: Right. So in
2013, and 2013, is when it first

863
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:22,050
got started, like, there's a lot
you can work on, right, like so

864
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,690
we had all these problems, just
getting the robot like getting

865
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:27,270
my application to work on all
these different robots. But

866
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:29,100
there's all this other stuff
like right, should we be doing

867
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,490
motion? To be What about
perception, what to focus

868
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:35,400
Audrow Nash: on, basically,
writers out there early on

869
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,990
things that you could possibly
focus on?

870
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:40,350
Matt Robinson: Okay. Yeah, my
apprentice, my predecessor, my

871
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:46,620
predecessor, Paul Voss, now and
plus one. He, he basically was

872
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:50,370
like, started, like, basically,
surveying industry is like, Hey,

873
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,010
what are some of your pain
points and work? What's really

874
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:57,390
working on it just naturally,
sort of like, like, hey, what if

875
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,520
we started a consortium, and you
chip in a little bit, and we

876
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,920
start building up this
repository and maintain it. And

877
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,060
for tools to enable you

878
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,400
Audrow Nash: to chip in a little
bit, you mean, you fund a little

879
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,390
bit so that, like, you have some
sort of stake, and it funds like

880
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:13,620
a few people to work on this
full time, most of their time.

881
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,320
Matt Robinson: That's the intent
of the consortium, right. So

882
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,740
there's some level of
maintenance, to keep things at

883
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:24,240
least running to a degree. And
so our membership dues are

884
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:31,470
different. Yeah. And then, and
then at enables, like some level

885
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:34,080
of technical support. So one of
the benefit benefits for people

886
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,600
who are involved in the
consortium, is they get some

887
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:40,890
call, like, hey, help me like
tech support. As well as like,

888
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:42,840
you know, we do a lot of
maintenance. And, of course,

889
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:47,160
obviously, pushing out some new
stuff fixes, new versions, etc,

890
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:52,620
we maintain the Qt plugin for
ROS. And different functions

891
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:56,190
like that. And put on obviously,
the training, it supports the

892
00:52:56,190 --> 00:53:00,240
training events. But that's
really what the dues cover any

893
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,790
sort of collaborative project is
separately specked out and if

894
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:06,480
people want to contribute
income, and software or, or just

895
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:10,590
fun labor, they can do that with
veggie spun out separate. So the

896
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:14,190
consortium seeks to provide the
direction for what we do in the

897
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:17,340
open source. The first thing,
sorry,

898
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,530
Audrow Nash: its direction in a
sense that they inform you of

899
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:24,690
what they're working on what
their needs are. But it also

900
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:30,210
comes with these added benefits
of you, you can you support

901
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:34,680
them. And then you also provide
these training things. Drink

902
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,710
training, I don't know the
courses or we may refer to it

903
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:41,310
Matt Robinson: to training
events, right? Yeah, we enable

904
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:44,190
them to sort of like kind of
influence the agenda, like, oh,

905
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:47,010
it'd be nice to have more more
on navigation. Right? Oh, we

906
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:50,610
generally, like we've started
pushing out ROS 2 training and

907
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:54,450
we got a lot of feedback that
like, Hey, this is fine. But

908
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:57,570
like, how do we make it run with
our ROS one stuff? Right. So we

909
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:01,680
ended? Yeah, add in like, yeah,
added, like best practices with

910
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,550
the bridge, pulling exercises,
and hey, what are some things

911
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:10,920
for to help us port stuff? And
so that's, and that that's a key

912
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,710
role, right? I mean, Oh, for
sure. consortium, the

913
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:17,760
membership, like provides this
sort of, well, and because they

914
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,340
are paying membership dues, they
will definitely express their

915
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,250
opinions. And that's right. I
mean, we're sure

916
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,790
Audrow Nash: if it's the best
match desires of industry,

917
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,560
represented by the consortium.

918
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:31,470
Matt Robinson: Yeah. So we have
like this, like, baked in voice

919
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:34,860
of voice of the customer. Right.
So that's been really good. And

920
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:37,860
then shortly after we started
the Americas consortium,

921
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:42,300
Fraunhofer IPA stood up a ROS
industrial consortium in Europe.

922
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:46,800
They have a subset of members
and Asia Pacific. Like I said,

923
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,600
let a Singapore RTC Singapore.
Were there one of your

924
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,880
colleagues, a couple of your
colleagues in Singapore I think

925
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:59,730
just down the road from RTC.
They support the Asia Pacific

926
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,250
console issue and when we work
all off, like a common

927
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:06,630
agreement, so we have reciprocal
benefits. And it's really very

928
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:12,150
uniform from either outside, as
well as inside. We tried to make

929
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:15,180
it consistent, uniform
experience, like very often

930
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,850
often Asia Pacific member who
has someone sitting here in the

931
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:22,110
States, and they'll attend our
training events. That's okay,

932
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,450
that's nice. How do you?

933
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:29,640
Audrow Nash: How does it work
when companies join the

934
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:34,260
consortium? Is it? So is it like
a fixed do or can companies

935
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:38,670
though? Like, if? I don't know,
I like say it's a $5,000 for one

936
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:43,200
seat, or something? Does it is
Can someone contribute a whole

937
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,160
bunch and basically monopolize
how it works? Or how does all I

938
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,720
guess how do you balance
different companies?

939
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:53,550
Matt Robinson: That's a good
question. So so we do true there

940
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,560
that we have an agreement,
right, and the agreement spells

941
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,310
out all the details. But in
general, right, we have

942
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:01,380
different classes of membership,
which kind of make it as

943
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,800
accessible as possible. So like
startups and universities, can

944
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:09,480
come in at $2,500 a year, they
get a seat at every event via

945
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:14,280
networking or training. And I
still get to, like say, like,

946
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:19,470
you know, provide feedback on
the roadmap. Now we have another

947
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:23,790
level is called the consortium
Advisory Council that's reserved

948
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:26,970
for like our full members, but
they each only still get a seat.

949
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,390
Right? Okay. Like, even like a
big heavy hitter may come in.

950
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:34,380
Right? And be like, right, like,
hey, everyone wanted to be this.

951
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:37,890
I'm like, Well, you've only got
one vote, right? It's yeah. But

952
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:41,520
it's only one. But in the case,
like, obviously, some members

953
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,120
abstain. They're happy to go
right. Like if the big hitter

954
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:49,800
comes in and says X. Obviously,
in the recent years, the dynamic

955
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,660
is, the consortium has evolved
quite a bit. We ran it kind of a

956
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,180
little bit more like, like US
industry folks who used to

957
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:01,710
running right with like, email
and like, but now like we have,

958
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,940
we had a nice tech infusion into
the consortium. And they're

959
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:10,410
ready to develop via spreads.
And like, what a word discourse,

960
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,930
and I've been like having to
like my old school members. I'm

961
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:17,220
like having to this is
discourse. Yeah. Okay. Right.

962
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:20,640
You can go out there and type
something. Yeah, it's, it's been

963
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,690
a, it's, it's bringing those two
worlds together. It's been. That

964
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:27,690
is interesting. But yeah,
everyone has the one vote. And I

965
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:31,410
still call, like, let's have a
Zoom meeting. I send them an

966
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:36,330
invite. And it's, it's still a
lot of hand holding, but it's

967
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:40,470
fine. Right. I mean, I, I know
the context of every member

968
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:44,220
pretty personally, right? I've
had one on one conversations

969
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,220
with all of them. They express
their concerns, like, sometimes

970
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:50,490
they're like, Oh, this is the
fit for us. And that's okay.

971
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:55,890
Right. I want to make sure that
they're getting the value, and

972
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,420
that we're meeting their needs.
And if they're not, they're

973
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,150
back. We're not right. And
that's fine, too. Oh, totally.

974
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:03,330
I'll get like, Well, can you put
me in touch with the person who

975
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:11,340
does ROS on marketing? But
like, yes, one second. I'm the

976
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:14,070
I'm the one stop shop. Like,
right? Yeah, I managed the

977
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:18,720
website. I do all the marketing.
I do a lot of events undergoing

978
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:23,730
the podcast. Yeah. Well, that's
not entirely true. Right. Our

979
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:27,750
developer group, some of you,
your your audience may know Levi

980
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:32,160
Armstrong. Right. So he has
spoken with our his or member

981
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,230
team member or team members,
Michael ripperger. Just recently

982
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:37,230
spoke at ROS con, we put on a
workshop, obviously, by

983
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:41,070
Armstrong and Dr. Chris Lewis,
on the scan to wear all the

984
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:41,490
hats, but

985
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:42,900
Audrow Nash: you wear many hats.
Yeah.

986
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:45,630
Matt Robinson: Jorge, Nico was
on the ROS developers podcast

987
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:50,880
that comes out of steam. So So
you know, I really tried to

988
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:56,280
provide the forum to allow the
team to shine. But obviously, I

989
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,590
was invited, and I'm happy to
talk about the program level.

990
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:01,110
But obviously, I'm happy to make
somebody a little bit more

991
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:05,580
developer centric available as
well. Okay,

992
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:09,810
Audrow Nash: let's see. So then,
okay, so you have the

993
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:12,870
consortium, it's all these
companies that sit on it, how

994
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:17,070
large is it? How many companies
do you have sitting on I guess

995
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:19,110
we have the three different
branches, but like somewhere

996
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:23,190
Matt Robinson: in general,
somewhere, I'm like 65, member

997
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:27,870
company range, and government
entities. So government entities

998
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:31,890
don't have to pay a member fee.
But they have to kind of they

999
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:33,960
don't get any of the member
benefits so they have to pay if

1000
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:39,990
they show up for like a meal.
But so like NIST is really great

1001
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:44,520
partner here in the state side.
So we've been really benefited

1002
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,500
that really good working
relationship with them Air Force

1003
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,940
Research Lab, you know, in
cardiac or Army Research,

1004
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:54,210
historically been the ones that
have really been great

1005
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:56,640
supporters of the work we're
trying to do in industrial open

1006
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,250
source. Yeah. I'm curious.

1007
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,940
Audrow Nash: So like My
experience with some nonprofits,

1008
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:06,510
I was with Robo hub, which is a
nonprofit news organization for

1009
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:10,950
robotics. And so we would go
around and try to find sponsors

1010
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:15,540
quite often. Are you? So for the
companies that you have in the

1011
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:20,250
consortium? Are you doing a lot
of like reaching out to

1012
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:24,600
different companies and trying
to kind of align? Or try to try

1013
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:28,710
to talk to the right people? And
then have them join? Or how does

1014
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:31,770
it? How does it work with this?
Are they coming to you, I

1015
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:33,600
suppose it's a mix of both. But

1016
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:38,790
Matt Robinson: I have to admit,
like, I could probably do more

1017
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:43,590
proactive, outreach. You know,
even we were at Caterpillar,

1018
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:46,170
like, they mentioned, like, hey,
we have this consortium, you can

1019
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:51,540
participate. You know, a lot of
times people reach out to us,

1020
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:54,870
you know, like, for instance,
if, if you have like, say, let's

1021
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:57,840
say there's a more tech oriented
company that like wants to get

1022
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:02,910
exposure to industry, they might
reach out. And then like, you

1023
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:06,000
know, for instance, have like,
like, when I was at Caterpillar,

1024
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:10,680
we needed help, but wanted to
learn ourselves. Right? So it

1025
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,200
was a good opportunity for us to
get exposure to the training in

1026
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,610
what's going on who are others?
What are others doing to solve

1027
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:21,300
some of these challenges. And
ideally, there's other some

1028
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,060
solution providers in that
network that that are already

1029
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:27,090
industry aligned. Right, because
the issue is working with a lot

1030
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:30,660
of startups, sometimes, at least
in the early 2010s. They weren't

1031
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:34,020
always really ready for
industry, the too early

1032
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:37,470
Audrow Nash: kind of thing. They
were still like pivoting, or

1033
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:39,780
whatever it might be, or they
were over fit

1034
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,640
Matt Robinson: to say their
initial industry, oh, my God.

1035
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:46,230
And so like, obviously hanging
out and ROS industry, we can

1036
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:48,480
kind of like, you know, these
other startups that were kind of

1037
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,560
engaging, they can kind of get a
little sense for, for the flavor

1038
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,740
of industrial member that's in
the consortium. Most of the

1039
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:58,500
industrial members in the
consortium are you know, hence

1040
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:01,860
there is no Ford or, well,
General Motors as a member now,

1041
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:06,450
but not in the context, you
might think. But like, you know,

1042
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:09,360
Ford at one time early on was a
member, but they're like, yeah,

1043
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:12,390
we can just tell the robot
providers what to do. Right. So

1044
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:13,410
this is less value.

1045
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:15,990
Audrow Nash: Oh, yeah, the big
company,

1046
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:18,780
Matt Robinson: they are looking
for more capability. Right? It's

1047
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,810
interesting, right? So even big
players like that BMW, right?

1048
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:26,700
Totally. Was they're trying to
do, there's a notion of lot size

1049
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:30,810
of one. And so that even though
you're making like 1000s of cars

1050
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,470
a lot size of one, so you're
making me I'm making, I'm making

1051
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:39,300
500 units a minute, right?
Normally, I might make batches.

1052
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,960
So what's what scrap? Why not,
why not be enough, right, so I'm

1053
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,580
going to make a 500 of the 700
series for settings, right, and

1054
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,040
I'm gonna have them be the same.
And then I'm going to follow it

1055
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:54,090
up with a bunch of my 500
series. Well, what they're

1056
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:56,670
trying to get to is this notion
of, of all the product they

1057
01:02:56,670 --> 01:03:00,000
make, they're gonna make 500 of
them, but it's gonna be all

1058
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:03,390
mixed, sprinkled in mixed by
teams, different sizes

1059
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:08,550
Audrow Nash: are dynamization.
It's like, it's highly dynamic

1060
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:12,330
to the needs of the company. So
it might be like, it might be

1061
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:15,390
like in the in the limit, it
might be like in like Walmart or

1062
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:18,510
something when someone buys a
product. And then Walmart ships

1063
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:21,030
that product to the Walmart
store kind of thing. Because of

1064
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:24,930
that data being taken. This car,
sends it right over,

1065
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,530
Matt Robinson: right, just in
time manufacturing, just in time

1066
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:32,580
delivery, just just in time
tagline. And like six sigma

1067
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:37,200
parlons supply chain is very
common in industry. And there's

1068
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,190
two sets here in the ROS
toolbox that can help deliver

1069
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:41,940
solutions for

1070
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,400
Audrow Nash: us, which mean a
lot of one for this, it's like I

1071
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,600
want to make one of one thing.
And then I want to go make

1072
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,350
something else.

1073
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:52,110
Matt Robinson: Right? It's got a
you can historically you would

1074
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:55,290
batch it, right? Gonna make so
many of the 700 series so many

1075
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:58,980
of the 500 series, so many of
the 300 series did to optimize

1076
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:02,430
my uptime. But manufacturers are
really wanting to get away from

1077
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:02,790
that they

1078
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:05,970
Audrow Nash: want that just in
time manufacturing. Interesting.

1079
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:07,950
Okay, and so

1080
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:11,670
Matt Robinson: and that's and
that's true, aerospace, heavy

1081
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:13,920
industry, oiling all industries.

1082
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:15,660
Audrow Nash: I mean, it's
basically saying I want

1083
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:18,120
flexibility is what I hear it's

1084
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,390
Matt Robinson: right. Or
agility, which is, you know,

1085
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,200
different yet.

1086
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:25,710
Audrow Nash: So how do you think
of them? Because I mean,

1087
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:29,490
flexibility is the ability to
pivot and make different things

1088
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:33,300
agility is the ability to change
quickly what you're making.

1089
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,320
Matt Robinson: Yeah, so you
might trade off velocity in an

1090
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:41,760
agile solution, right? So
flexibility, right, so Oh, boy.

1091
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,590
It's like getting to
manufacturing lingo. So so if

1092
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:50,310
I'm machining agent, right,
let's say I make lots of

1093
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:53,400
different interests, different
sizes lawnmowers to dump trucks.

1094
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:58,410
I can I can buy a machining
center with a huge material

1095
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:02,850
handling setup with all All the
holding hardware to hold all my

1096
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:05,220
different size engines. And that
way I can put all the metal

1097
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:08,130
blocks I need on these like
pallets that are shuttled

1098
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:12,210
around. That's a very flexible
system. But it's also very

1099
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:14,790
expensive, right because like
I've got this like conveyor

1100
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:19,470
system, I've got all this extra
tooling. Agile solution might

1101
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:22,770
be, I have a mobile robot with a
spindle on it, that can like

1102
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:25,650
brace it, and stay reverie, so
but it might be slight, it can

1103
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:27,900
roll, it can roll up on the
various engine blocks and put

1104
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,720
all the holes in it needs.
That's a magic solution. Now,

1105
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,000
it's not going to make each one
as fast because it's a little

1106
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,790
robot, and it's not as rigid.
But I have I have less setup. I

1107
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:42,090
have like, you know, my floor
space can be very dynamic. I

1108
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:44,040
don't have this huge thing that
takes up the space on my

1109
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,100
factory. That is an agile
solution. Right? So this notion

1110
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:50,790
of to your point, right, I can
respond more nimbly to changes

1111
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:54,480
in condition. Flexible means
I've designed my equipment to

1112
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,560
handle all my permutations.
Yeah, but maybe the trade offs

1113
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,720
on consuming floorspace or
cotton,

1114
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,790
Audrow Nash: maybe it's flexible
only in what you're already

1115
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:06,720
making and not flexible and new
things to work. Maybe agile

1116
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,450
could adapt more readily. Okay,

1117
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,820
Matt Robinson: there's actually
an agility and robotics Working

1118
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:15,900
Group in nest. And we talk
extensively about the defining

1119
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:19,380
agility, right. It's a real nice
conversation. It's actually

1120
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:23,040
official IEEE working group. So
if your listeners are interested

1121
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:26,070
in that, I'm happy to make
introductions or, you know,

1122
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:27,360
through education channels.

1123
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:29,850
Audrow Nash: Again, you can drop
your contact info and

1124
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:34,140
everything. But one thing kind
of so you mentioned this working

1125
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,930
group, you had a working group
approved in the steering

1126
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:38,880
committee. Yesterday.

1127
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,190
Matt Robinson: Let's let's fresh
off the presses.

1128
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:45,150
Audrow Nash: fresh off the
press. Yeah. And as so would you

1129
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:48,450
talk a bit about the intention
of the working group? And then

1130
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:52,170
like, maybe how people would get
involved if they are interested?

1131
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:56,790
Matt Robinson: Yeah. So this is
also very new. Right. So

1132
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:58,890
anyways, yeah. So So

1133
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,080
Audrow Nash: approved yesterday,
steering committee meeting,

1134
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:05,100
Matt Robinson: like this Europe,
you're very plugged in. So yes,

1135
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:09,000
the Technical Steering Committee
met yesterday, we had put on

1136
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,840
discourse, this idea of a
hardware interfaces working

1137
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:17,250
group. So one of the exciting
things about our work with

1138
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,730
industry in ROS, is the notion
of being able to abstract away

1139
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:24,300
the hardware to enable like,
hey, I can run this on a yellow

1140
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:28,110
robot and a blue rose. Bowl, one
thing we've seen over time, from

1141
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:33,180
our experience in ROS 1, as
OEM, some OEMs, did pick up the

1142
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:36,570
initiative to build their own
interfaces for us. Others did

1143
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:38,850
not, but the community would
step in and offer something.

1144
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:42,870
Well, I don't over time, some
OEMs would offer like this

1145
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:45,540
totally different type of
interface. So

1146
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,180
Audrow Nash: right, then you
mean software interface for

1147
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:51,690
this, right? Yes, correct. So
you're meaning if some company

1148
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:55,920
builds a depth sensor or
something? Maybe they would

1149
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,890
write drivers for it. And maybe
those drivers could have a ROS

1150
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:01,080
interface. So you can use it
really well with the ROS

1151
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:05,880
ecosystem? Maybe it wouldn't, is
what you're saying. But there's

1152
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,230
Okay. Well, so yeah.

1153
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:11,940
Matt Robinson: But the behavior
would be mo not consistent.

1154
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,870
Right. So you have a ROS
driver. And you would expect it

1155
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:18,660
to be like, Well, when I worked
on this hardware, this sort of

1156
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,300
this is the type this type of
message usually resulted in this

1157
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:22,050
behavior. So if I

1158
01:08:22,049 --> 01:08:24,659
Audrow Nash: have a dense camera
by this company, a and a depth

1159
01:08:24,659 --> 01:08:28,409
camera by Company B, the ideally
the drivers have the same

1160
01:08:28,409 --> 01:08:32,969
interfaces. So I can just plug
in replace one, if I'm using

1161
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:36,209
like, say I'm using a, I can
just swap to B, and my interface

1162
01:08:36,209 --> 01:08:38,489
is the same. So there's no
standardization in the

1163
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:41,999
interfaces. Yes, similar cases,
what you're saying racks?

1164
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:44,520
Matt Robinson: Yes, we're
similar to industrial

1165
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:49,530
manipulators, that became in
spades. Right? So yeah, and

1166
01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:51,750
because, you know, and
obviously, because they are

1167
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:54,900
different, but an are dry for
specification, when the author

1168
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:58,560
has the time didn't think about
how those products would evolve.

1169
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,830
And it wasn't necessarily even
associated with it just defined

1170
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:05,430
in eskies. We didn't actually
say like the associated with

1171
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:10,710
behavior. So it's this notion of
taking our specifications that

1172
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:13,560
we worked on in the past, and
maybe extending it to behavior.

1173
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,670
So when you're developing your
application, you know the

1174
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:20,250
interface and we want to create
a reference implementation that

1175
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:23,370
makes it easier for people who
are Hey, great, awesome, that

1176
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:26,430
people are offering ROS
interfaces, right? And building

1177
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:31,530
interfaces to enable open source
and interoperability at all. But

1178
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:34,110
but if we can do something where
like provide reference

1179
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:37,200
implementations that are
associated with anticipated or

1180
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:40,050
expected behavior, we think that
would lead to a better developer

1181
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:44,070
or end user experience,
particularly auditing the test

1182
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:47,160
Audrow Nash: and also easier for
software engineers. Like

1183
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:50,010
obviously easier if I have an
interface to program to and I

1184
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:52,320
like if that abstraction is
already done, so I don't have to

1185
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:55,230
reinvent it. If I am thinking
I'm gonna end up switching depth

1186
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:58,140
cameras at some point and it's
just good practice to make it so

1187
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:03,810
you abstract to But so just
baking that, and how are you

1188
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:05,700
guys proposing to do that?

1189
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:09,420
Matt Robinson: So I have to
admit, I didn't not write the

1190
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:13,470
details of the proposal. I just
know like I've dealt with the

1191
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:15,180
inconsistency in the interface.

1192
01:10:16,289 --> 01:10:19,049
Audrow Nash: But we're trying to
fix it for ROS 2. So the

1193
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:23,219
ecosystem doesn't develop quite
as much as ROS one without

1194
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:28,619
establishing a better norm.
handleless guardrails. Okay,

1195
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:32,100
Matt Robinson: yeah, so the,
what we're going to do is,

1196
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,290
obviously, we're going to
revisit a lot of the different

1197
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:37,230
applicable standards. So there's
been some good standards work in

1198
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:40,680
this domain, particularly in
industrial science. So we know

1199
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,140
in Europe, there's been a few
different standards, I can't

1200
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:46,440
rattle them off top, my head
bear with me. But there's gonna

1201
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,300
be a standards review,
obviously, we'd like to take

1202
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:52,680
some of the best in class, if
you will, start there. And then

1203
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,660
maybe, like, try to benchmark
them against a couple of the

1204
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:57,810
other implementations we've seen
out there. And again, targeted

1205
01:10:57,810 --> 01:11:02,850
around. Like how we handle
messaging for like, again, we're

1206
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:05,190
going to start with industrial
manipulators, because that's

1207
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:09,360
been a pain point for us and,
and how we, how we handle like,

1208
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,120
say, like the streaming and you
know, the joint streaming, and

1209
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,570
then you know, how we did some
of the behaviors relative

1210
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,660
resulting to like, hey, that,
that didn't really go off, like

1211
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:21,960
I expected. And then how do we
make sure we create a reference

1212
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,320
implementation that works over a
different couple cases? And

1213
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,890
because some OEMs are gonna also
add on functionality? Yeah, we

1214
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:30,630
got to make sure the reference
implementation accounts for that

1215
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:33,210
second bolt that in? Yeah,
certainly.

1216
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:36,750
Audrow Nash: So it works with
existing data structures, you

1217
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,960
basically say, Oh, well, we
expect that you might have these

1218
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,450
additional, like fields of data
that you're going to pass

1219
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:45,600
everywhere. And so it's built
into a standard interface,

1220
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,900
rather than we keep having to
extend it for specific use

1221
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,310
cases. There's kind of

1222
01:11:50,999 --> 01:11:53,609
Matt Robinson: I think your
metaphor is around depth cameras

1223
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:56,159
are a little simpler to speak
around and are valid.

1224
01:11:56,249 --> 01:12:01,589
Absolutely. Very similar. And so
yeah, we're looking forward,

1225
01:12:01,589 --> 01:12:04,259
we've got some good feedback,
the discourse conversation,

1226
01:12:04,259 --> 01:12:07,859
obviously, TSC, we, you know,
you may not know, but CNC

1227
01:12:07,859 --> 01:12:10,319
meetings are very fast paced.
You can't really belabor

1228
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:13,379
anyone's subject too much. But
in general, there seem to be

1229
01:12:13,379 --> 01:12:15,569
receptive audience, obviously,
we're asked how we're going to

1230
01:12:15,569 --> 01:12:19,559
sustain? I think that's a very
fair question. We as with

1231
01:12:19,559 --> 01:12:22,319
anything, open source projects,
we tend to get a lot of interest

1232
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:25,949
upfront, and then it kind of
computer down. So I think as

1233
01:12:25,949 --> 01:12:29,159
long as we get sort of a core
group, I think the big thing is

1234
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:31,979
having access to hardware, we're
lucky that we have plenty of

1235
01:12:31,979 --> 01:12:34,619
hardware around the couple of
the other partners that voiced

1236
01:12:34,619 --> 01:12:36,989
interest have access to
hardware. And that's a great

1237
01:12:36,989 --> 01:12:39,629
place to start. But obviously,
we're going to be looking for

1238
01:12:39,629 --> 01:12:42,299
other folks who maybe only have
a very specific piece of

1239
01:12:42,299 --> 01:12:45,839
hardware to test. And obviously,
we'll do our engagement with our

1240
01:12:45,839 --> 01:12:49,439
OEM friends to see what their
take is, because we have a

1241
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:52,829
number of OEMs interested in
building out interfaces for us,

1242
01:12:52,829 --> 01:12:55,799
too, they don't know where to
start. So that's where also the

1243
01:12:55,799 --> 01:12:58,199
timing is beneficial. We'll hand
you this reference

1244
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:03,179
implementation. Right, go give
feedback. And since we, yeah, we

1245
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:06,269
have some industrial medullary
EMS interested in rolling out.

1246
01:13:07,259 --> 01:13:10,769
And they're already looking at
ROS 2 control. So that's good.

1247
01:13:10,769 --> 01:13:12,809
And that's that's where it
really gets into like behavior,

1248
01:13:12,809 --> 01:13:15,269
right? Because our a lot of our
past drivers were a little bit

1249
01:13:15,269 --> 01:13:18,419
more simplified. But now that
everyone's pivoting to ROS,

1250
01:13:18,419 --> 01:13:22,889
control based drivers, that's
the right time to do this more,

1251
01:13:23,369 --> 01:13:30,719
more behavior centric approach.
Do you? See?

1252
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,000
Audrow Nash: Are you
considering? Like, will you

1253
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,610
write ROS enhancement proposal
for this kind of thing? Or? Like

1254
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,320
do you imagine like making a
public specification of exactly

1255
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:47,610
what these may look like? Or
maybe it's like, for mobile,

1256
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:49,590
manipulate or for manipulators?

1257
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,650
Matt Robinson: Yeah, I have a
feeling it'd be more

1258
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:57,780
specification based, if you
will. I said we, we would like

1259
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:00,900
to go back and review existing
standards, as opposed to trading

1260
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:04,080
the standard that supposedly
rules them all. In the

1261
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,240
industrial circles, right?
Someone's always creating the

1262
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:11,910
standard, that standard, I'd
like to avoid that. In the meaty

1263
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:14,670
part is the reference
implementation, right? So we

1264
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:17,550
obviously will have a wiki page
someplace to steer people to for

1265
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:19,920
like, an of course, an
associated GitHub repository

1266
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,080
that came to contains the
framework for whatever the

1267
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:26,130
reference implementation looks
like. But ideally, right, we are

1268
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:29,250
bolting in the applicable
standards, not reinventing

1269
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:34,020
standards, but it'd be more
around the proper documentation

1270
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:38,010
as opposed to like us, maybe
making like under the hood ROS

1271
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:39,090
enhancements per se.

1272
01:14:39,509 --> 01:14:41,429
Audrow Nash: Right. These are,
you know what I mean by ROS

1273
01:14:41,429 --> 01:14:42,689
enhancement proposal.

1274
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:49,110
Matt Robinson: And a rap Yes.
Yeah, right. I don't I don't

1275
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:51,630
know necessarily explicitly
become a rep at this point in

1276
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:52,920
time. Maybe Gotcha.

1277
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:57,450
Audrow Nash: Perhaps once the
feedback is just so in, as far

1278
01:14:57,450 --> 01:15:01,170
as I understand, it's really
nice. If anything, It's a it's a

1279
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:04,950
space that the community looks
to see if there are standards

1280
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:09,060
for things. And so it seems like
a good spot for like, this is

1281
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:13,680
what we think would be good for
a, say we're doing like a

1282
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:17,010
robotic arm. This is what a good
message type for a vendor might

1283
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:20,010
be. But I don't know. Just a
good point.

1284
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,850
Matt Robinson: Obviously, it's
been challenging because so many

1285
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:26,340
different specifications of our
robot, our robot vendors don't

1286
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:30,990
necessarily, they don't know
what a rep is. Right. So so, you

1287
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:34,920
know, we, we tend to try to find
places that they're more

1288
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,970
accessible to some of the more
traditional industrial segments.

1289
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:41,580
Well, I think, yeah, we'll have
to take while to take that all

1290
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:45,030
under consideration, I believe,
now that you know, we talk about

1291
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:48,120
it out loud. The rap does sound
like a great place, and you can

1292
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,280
obviously be pushed in reference
other places.

1293
01:15:50,429 --> 01:15:53,549
Audrow Nash: Yes, totally. I
think it kind of seems like a

1294
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:59,489
good way to go. If you're trying
to change how a large group of

1295
01:15:59,489 --> 01:16:03,899
users might use ROS. It's like
the way to have standards, as

1296
01:16:03,899 --> 01:16:07,349
far as I understand. And also,
reference implementations are

1297
01:16:07,349 --> 01:16:10,889
very important in reps. So I
think if you're making a

1298
01:16:10,889 --> 01:16:14,369
reference reference
implementation, it's like the

1299
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:17,099
part of the rep that is the
content of your reference

1300
01:16:17,099 --> 01:16:20,369
implementation and the spec and
everything out the rationale,

1301
01:16:20,459 --> 01:16:24,869
everything I quite like the form
of it and, like, filling that

1302
01:16:24,869 --> 01:16:26,279
space out. Seems good to me.

1303
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:28,860
Matt Robinson: But no, and you
see, this is the this the

1304
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:34,800
benefit of this particular
podcast? No, yeah, no, I, like I

1305
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,590
said, and obviously, as we begin
this journey, I think we'll

1306
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:42,030
probably hash through some of
those, some of those. For sure.

1307
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:45,570
In the wrap sounds like to me
like, yeah, natural and natural

1308
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,290
step forward.

1309
01:16:47,129 --> 01:16:50,519
Audrow Nash: So we are coming at
the end of the time, I do have

1310
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:53,849
some other questions. If you do
not have a hard stop, I'd love

1311
01:16:53,849 --> 01:16:56,009
to talk a little longer. I know
we started late because of

1312
01:16:56,009 --> 01:16:57,179
technical difficulties.

1313
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:01,410
Matt Robinson: But yeah, I got
Yeah, I can I know that are

1314
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:02,880
1010 12 minutes. That's good.

1315
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:09,840
Audrow Nash: So the thing that
so looking at ROS industrial

1316
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:13,800
the group in general, there's a
lot of things that are offered.

1317
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:20,580
One other thing is the
conference, ROS industrial con,

1318
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:21,480
or how do you

1319
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:25,560
Matt Robinson: call it? So so we
have three different events,

1320
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:28,050
because we're like a federated
organization with Europe and

1321
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:32,280
Asia Pacific. So we each each
group puts on like sort of a

1322
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,880
member gathering, if you will, a
lot of cases a events

1323
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,470
Audrow Nash: you're speaking
about.

1324
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:40,800
Matt Robinson: Okay, right. And
then we obviously do some other

1325
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,110
smaller events as well. But
these are kind of like our big

1326
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:47,940
marquee events for each region.
So ROS industrial conference is

1327
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:51,420
specifically that of that name
is the one that's typically held

1328
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:55,530
at the end of the year. I think
it's been considered moved away

1329
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:59,430
from December. But typically
it's in December units, hosted

1330
01:17:59,430 --> 01:18:02,940
by ROS industrial Europe, and
then Fraunhofer IPA, and

1331
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:07,980
typically in Stuttgart, Germany.
And they, they'll organize

1332
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:12,990
typically their event as both
member and public over the whole

1333
01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:16,080
event, and obviously bring
together lots of different

1334
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,500
speakers. Right. And so there's
tends to be conference in a very

1335
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,870
traditional sense, where it's a
number of different speakers.

1336
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:25,380
Maybe they'll have some tours
and have people set up

1337
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:29,340
demonstrations as well, to make
it more interactive. So that's

1338
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:34,290
once a year, Asia Pacific hosts
what they call a ROS industrial

1339
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:38,610
workshop lesson destroy Asia
Pacific workshop. It is probably

1340
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:43,710
somewhat similar. I believe it
is also public and member over

1341
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:46,800
the whole time, you may have
some separate member breakout

1342
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,860
time. It's been a while since
we've had one in person because

1343
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:55,110
COVID COVID. But our group we've
we've been over Singapore, we

1344
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:58,470
support that one actively as
well. And then of course,

1345
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:03,840
Americas we typically host ours
in the spring. It is moving a

1346
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,450
little later this year, because
in the every other year we were

1347
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:10,350
co locating with the Automate
conference. And this year,

1348
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:14,010
automate is in June because
they're separating from Pro

1349
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:17,940
Matte, which is in the spring
and in Chicago, automate is now

1350
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:21,480
splitting off separate from Pro
matte, and we'll be in Detroit.

1351
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,680
Our event is a little different.
When we host it here in San

1352
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:29,760
Antonio, we have kind of public
day and then member of the day,

1353
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:33,750
like because when I get all the
members together, we tend to try

1354
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:37,200
to have workshops were like hey,
what are we doing good? What's

1355
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,880
not going so reflective

1356
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,280
Audrow Nash: now that you have
everyone together? Yeah, what

1357
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:41,580
are your

1358
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:44,130
Matt Robinson: burning needs?
And so we like get out the Get

1359
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:46,980
out the huge notepads and we're
like got everybody in little

1360
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:50,610
small groups. And it's cool and
we try to we try to hash out

1361
01:19:50,610 --> 01:19:54,210
things and like just a smaller
setting. The public day is like

1362
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:57,060
a big conference release. We'll
have like lab tours like members

1363
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:59,790
will come and set up, set up
demos. People can play with

1364
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:04,560
stuff We try to make it active.
And of course, we do that we do

1365
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,430
the presentation gamut as well.
Last year, ours was virtual as

1366
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:13,140
well. And thanks to all of our
members and and folks in the

1367
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:16,740
open source community who came
and supported and spoke, folks

1368
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:20,490
from Open Robotics as well. We
really appreciate the support

1369
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:23,640
and the collaboration. It's been
fun, obviously, bringing all

1370
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:26,070
these, it's great to get all
these folks together sharing

1371
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:29,760
ideas. We look forward to kind
of getting back in person. So

1372
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,900
our event is Detroit. Automate
runs from Monday through

1373
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:38,070
Thursday. And then our event is
Friday in Detroit. We're doing a

1374
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:40,980
big a big dinner Thursday, we're
going to highlight all the ROS

1375
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:46,140
centric demos at automate on the
show floor. So we'll put out a

1376
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:48,330
little cheat sheet like hey, if
you want to see something ROS

1377
01:20:48,330 --> 01:20:51,930
running under the hood, go here,
here and here. Of course, we'll

1378
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:54,360
we'll get together Friday and
share kind of some of the

1379
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,610
happenings what's going on in
our collaboration projects,

1380
01:20:56,610 --> 01:21:01,260
blah, blah, blah. And that'll be
in June. And we make all of that

1381
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:04,860
content. Some member only
content, obviously, there's a

1382
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:08,250
member portal, but most of it,
I'd say like 80% of the content

1383
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:11,310
we put up on our YouTube
channel. And of course, we make

1384
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:15,240
all the slide decks available.
Do write ups about like, kind of

1385
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:17,400
what we learned and stuff and
trying to get that information

1386
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:17,760
on there.

1387
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:21,750
Audrow Nash: Gotcha. Have you?
Have you noticed any? Like, what

1388
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:27,120
have you noticed? How long have
these conferences been going? Is

1389
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:30,900
it several years? So it sounds
like consortium in 2013? Or?

1390
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:33,990
Matt Robinson: Yes. So the first
can ROS industrial consortium

1391
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:38,280
member meeting was in 2013. I
attended my first one in 2014.

1392
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:41,430
Audrow Nash: Wow, you're so
early on it. Okay,

1393
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:45,600
Matt Robinson: so yeah, as was a
caterpillar person, right? Yep.

1394
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:51,930
And then I hosted my first one
as a here. I think it was 2018.

1395
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:54,960
I posted? What?

1396
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:58,320
Audrow Nash: What have you
noticed for the like, is it

1397
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:01,620
growing? Because ISO going to
robotics conferences in the last

1398
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:06,660
10 years or so? They've just
gotten huge. Are you noticing a

1399
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:10,410
similar trend or any, across the
years?

1400
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:15,750
Matt Robinson: Are? I think, you
know, we typically have to cap

1401
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:18,990
it. Like around like, when I do
it here, I have to cap it around

1402
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:21,990
like 110. It looks like a
Detroit I'm I have to cap it

1403
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:27,930
around 100. So it just fills up
faster. Right. That's cool. Like

1404
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:30,900
any conference, like we'll get
like in certain cases, like, you

1405
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:34,320
know, over registrants, I think
in general, people want to come

1406
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,510
and see what's going on. And
particularly, there's a lot of

1407
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:40,380
demos a chance to get hands on.
Yeah, drives a lot of a lot of

1408
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:44,160
interest. It's definitely not as
big as ROS brands were more

1409
01:22:44,610 --> 01:22:48,810
audience. But we have good
industry engagement, good engage

1410
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:51,180
with the tech community. It's a
great time for those two,

1411
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:54,030
sometimes still very different
communities to get together and

1412
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:54,960
share ideas.

1413
01:22:55,259 --> 01:23:00,569
Audrow Nash: Yeah. All right. So
beginning to wrap up. Where do

1414
01:23:00,569 --> 01:23:04,739
you see ROS industry going? Or
ROS industrial going in the

1415
01:23:04,739 --> 01:23:08,489
next two, five years? Like,
where do you think it'll go?

1416
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:11,610
Matt Robinson: Yeah, I think
we're at a real tipping point,

1417
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:14,730
where it's not just like, say a
custom application for

1418
01:23:14,730 --> 01:23:20,010
industrial use. That gets
deployed or like at Site x,

1419
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:23,070
we're, I think we're reaching a
point where at least certain

1420
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:27,090
classes of applications can be
sort of generalized and this

1421
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:30,300
notion of like creating like an
app for a class of applications,

1422
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,470
maybe even realize that right,
where you can, like pull down

1423
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:37,740
something via snap for those
snap is like sort of the app

1424
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:39,660
store for Linux. You can

1425
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:41,670
Audrow Nash: pull from
specifically, I don't know if

1426
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:44,760
it's all windows. Sorry, isn't
going to specifically you're

1427
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:47,760
correct. And one of the more
recent versions, even more

1428
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,350
specifically, but yes,

1429
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:53,040
Matt Robinson: yes. But but in
this notion of like sort of like

1430
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,920
this app, or I can pull up
something, configure my

1431
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,040
environment, my hardware, so
moving some things around

1432
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:04,560
through some menus, and actually
do some basic sort of path

1433
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,890
planning and setting up a bar
and visualization and maybe

1434
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:13,560
hardware. I think, in the next
year or so, we might have some

1435
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:17,310
sort of AP, deployable solutions
that are basically really just

1436
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:20,790
ROS on industrial hardware. And
that's really exciting. I think

1437
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:25,650
it can really open up different,
like a new capability to a whole

1438
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:28,680
different set of users. And
obviously, on the training side,

1439
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,930
we're really excited to see
universities offering more

1440
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:34,950
training to manufacturing
engineering type people,

1441
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:39,600
mechanical engineers, to get
exposed to ROS technicians. So

1442
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,670
this notion of like, if I put a
bunch of robots out there, or

1443
01:24:41,670 --> 01:24:44,190
Ryan ROS, what is the
technician who has to fix the

1444
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:48,000
robot do with the raw space that
that piece of the education

1445
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,440
pipeline is still lacking?
There's a couple of programs

1446
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:55,140
Wichita State, for instance, has
been looking at a program for

1447
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,390
developing technicians for raw
space systems. We're really

1448
01:24:57,390 --> 01:25:00,810
excited to see see how that
evolves and been very supportive

1449
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:04,050
of those educational
initiatives. So it's not like

1450
01:25:04,050 --> 01:25:08,970
that just makes it right Oh,
yeah.

1451
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:12,360
Audrow Nash: And then do you
have any links or contact info

1452
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:16,230
that you'd like to share with
our listeners and watchers? Yeah

1453
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:19,230
Matt Robinson: obviously Twitter
at ROS industrial we have a

1454
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:24,630
LinkedIn page both myself
personally ROS industrial and

1455
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:27,660
LinkedIn pages ROS industrial
feel free to to follow us there.

1456
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:30,420
We obviously have a specific
discourse category as well, ROS

1457
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:34,320
industrial, we try to try to try
to have some discourse about

1458
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:40,140
ROS industrial there. There
bear with the battle. So but

1459
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:44,880
yeah, I am engaged on the in my
team and our colleagues in

1460
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:51,180
Europe and Asia, as well. So we
were actively looking forward to

1461
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:53,580
hearing what people's pain
points are, what can we be doing

1462
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:57,690
better? How do we how do we how
do we increase the acceptance

1463
01:25:57,690 --> 01:26:00,870
and participation? So that's the
other piece, right? How do we

1464
01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:04,020
get this industry community to
also be actively engaging and

1465
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:07,800
participating contributing to
open source? That's probably one

1466
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:12,510
side of our, our queue there
Rubik that, that we're still

1467
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:15,000
still working on. But I think
we're getting there. We're

1468
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:15,540
getting closer.

1469
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:19,440
Audrow Nash: And if people want
to join your working group, any

1470
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,930
idea how to? Yeah,

1471
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,210
Matt Robinson: so voice voice
your interest over in the

1472
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,790
discourse category? I think it's
the working group proposals

1473
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:29,760
under ROS discourse. Next
Generation. It's called Working

1474
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,390
Group proposal for interfaces.
So voice or just ping me

1475
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:34,740
directly via one of the
channels.

1476
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,040
Audrow Nash: Awesome. And
actually, you guys, maybe we'll

1477
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:42,180
be making a pull request to the
ROS 2 documentation and adding

1478
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:46,410
your working group info there. I
assume. You let me know if you

1479
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:48,150
need any pointers on that.

1480
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,030
Matt Robinson: I'll probably
have to delegate that right.

1481
01:26:51,450 --> 01:26:54,690
Perfect, but um, but I'm sure
we'll figure it out once we

1482
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:58,470
figure out what the next steps
are. So often, other than

1483
01:26:58,470 --> 01:27:04,230
hearing that it's ago, I haven't
gotten early. The next step is

1484
01:27:04,230 --> 01:27:09,420
the most concrete next step I've
heard so far. Okay, says that is

1485
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:11,820
educational for me as it is
relative to listeners.

1486
01:27:12,570 --> 01:27:15,570
Audrow Nash: Awesome. Well,
thank you, Matt. Bye, everyone.

1487
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:23,400
Bye. Thanks for listening to
this conversation with Matt

1488
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:27,000
Robinson. Thank you again to our
founding sponsor, Open Robotics.

1489
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:27,960
See you next time.
